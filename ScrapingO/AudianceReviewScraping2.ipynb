       "   'Critic': 'The Shawshank Redemption: Special Edition\\nEvery movie trivia buff worth his or her salt can rattle off the titles of at least half a dozen films that tanked when they first hit theaters, only to be recognized later as all-time favorites. Some fall under the \"cult\" banner — Office Space, The Princess Bride (fans as rabid as Buttercup and Westley\\'s definitely qualify for cult standing) — but others are movies that have become synonymous with \"classic\": It\\'s a Wonderful Life and Casablanca are two prime examples ... and so is The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Director Frank Darabont\\'s moving period prison drama (based on Stephen King\\'s short story \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\") earned only $28 million at the box office, yet 10 years after its release, it regularly tops popularity polls. Perhaps moviegoers originally stayed away because of the mouthful of a title, or maybe it was Columbia\\'s ineffective theatrical marketing campaign, which made Shawshank out to be one of those worthwhile-but-depressing dramas that\\'s only for the stoutest of heart. But thanks to home video and countless cable TV airings, Shawshank — which, despite its poor business performance, earned critical raves and seven Oscar nominations — eventually found its audience. And who can blame them for becoming besotted? The story of mild-mannered inmate Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), wrongly jailed in the 1940s for murdering his wife and her lover, and his transforming friendship with veteran prisoner Red (Morgan Freeman) is the kind of inspiring tale that we love the movies for in the first place. Thrown defenseless into a world ruled by bullies in uniform on both sides of the law, Andy comes to understand that his only chance is to believe things can be different. He clings to that hope in the face of nearly insurmountable challenges, not the least of which is dealing with self-righteous Warden Norton (Bob Gunton, who nails the oily condescension of a corrupt man convinced of his own moral superiority), who quickly realizes that Andy, an accountant \"on the outside,\" could be very useful. The cast is uniformly excellent. Robbins\\' glassy-eyed vacancy seems particularly suited to a prisoner who dreams of being anywhere but where he is, and Freeman makes Red\\'s common-sense approach to life seem like the highest form of wisdom. Old pro James Whitmore is endearing as lifelong Shawshank inmate Brooks, William Sadler offers some welcome comic relief as Heywood, and Gil Bellows turns in what is still a career-high performance as cocky newcomer Tommy. And, of course, there\\'s Clancy Brown, who does an excellent job making the audience hate him as cruel prison guard Captain Hadley. Darabont does double duty as screenwriter and director, and his talents in both areas are clear. He makes the most of the contrast between the film\\'s dank atmosphere and stirring message of hope, creating a true classic that will continue to stand the test of time. A fitting tribute to Shawshank\\'s enduring popularity, Warner\\'s \"10th Anniversary\" two-disc set offers the film in an anamorphic transfer (1.85:1) from a source-print that\\'s aged well. Audio options include English Dolby Digital 5.1 and French 2.0 Surround, as well as English, Spanish, and French subtitles. Extras on the first disc are limited to the trailer and a thoughtful, informative commentary by Darabont (his first one, as it happens). The bulk of the bonus features are on Disc Two, which includes a 30-minute retrospective featurette (\"Hope Springs Eternal\"); a 48-minute documentary that originally aired on British television (\"Shawshank: The Redeeming Feature\"); a Charlie Rose Show interview with Darabont, Robbins, and Freeman; the L.A. talent agency-set parody short \"The SharkTank Redemption\" (which stars Freeman\\'s son Alfonso); and the usual round-up of stills, storyboards, and promo artwork. Dual-DVD slimline keep-case.\\n—Betsy Bozdech\\nBack to Quick Reviews Index: [A-F] [G-L] [M-R] [S-Z]\\nBack to Main Page'},\n",

Quiet and introspective, he gradually strikes up a friendship with the prison 'fixer', Red (Freeman), and over the next two decades wins the trust of the governor and guards, but in his heart, he still yearns for freedom. Darabont's adaptation of a Stephen King novella is a throwback to the kind of serious, literate drama Hollywood used to make (Birdman of Alcatraz, say) though the big spiritual resolution takes some swallowing - ditto the colour-blind relationships within the prison and the violent disavowal of any homosexual implications. Against this weighs the pleasure of discovering a first-time director with evident respect for the intelligence of his audience, brave enough to let character details accumulate without recourse to the fast-forward button. Darabont plays the long game and wins: this is an engrossing, superbly acted yarn, while the Shawshank itself is a truly formidable mausoleum.\\nRelease Details\\nDuration:\\n142 mins\\nCast and crew\\nDirector:\\nFrank Darabont\\nScreenwriter:\\nFrank Darabont\\nCast:\\nTim Robbins\\nMorgan Freeman\\nBob Gunton\\nWilliam Sadler\\nClancy Brown\\nGil Bellows\\nMark Rolston\\nBeen there, done that?

Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top \"prison\" movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well! The film touches upon many subjects, including the ideas of hope, redemption, love, loneliness, justice, life/death, friendship, endurance, fear, patience, inspiration and so much more.\\n\\nWatching this movie always makes me feel a million times better, and if that\\'s not the greatest reason to watch a film, I don\\'t know what is. Give it up to both Freeman and Robbins for completely engulfing their characters with heart, soul and the spirit of humanity. I appreciated the message in this film, I absolutely loved the way it ended, I surrendered to its pace, I enjoyed all of its characters, I thought it was wonderfully photographed, I loved the score and I could seriously watch this movie 10 times a year and not bat an eyelash the whole way through.\\n\\nAnd what kind of banner year was 1994?? PULP FICTION, FORREST GUMP, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL (one of my favorite romantic comedies of all-time) were all nominated for Best Picture. It\\'s really too bad that most everyone got swept by that chocolate-lover, but no matter what the Academy deemed \"better\" that year, it goes without saying that SHAWSHANK has developed an even greater audience and following since that time, and is probably one of the most appreciated movies from the past twenty years (I usually NEVER hyperbolize any of my reviews (this is the BEST EVER...this is the WORST EVER...), but in this case, this film takes that cake and damn well, eats it too!).\\n\\nLove it, watch it, get your own motivation from it and surrender to its spirit which gives anyone in the world hope to do whatever they dream to do in life. It\\'s like I quoted back at the top of this review, you better \"get busy living, or get busy dying\". It don\\'t get more black and white than that. Your choice.\\n\\nA true cinematic inspiration.\\n\\n(c) 2006 Berge Garabedian\\n\\n\\n9/10\\nRegister to Post | Schmoes Gallery | Rules / Guidelines\\nUsername:\\nPassword:\\n  Not Registered?

The judge, noting Andy\\'s lack of remorse, puts him away for life. Andy is shipped to prison, an innocent man slipping through the cracks of a flawed system to toil in its bowels.\\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is an unhurried, engulfing prison drama that tracks Andy\\'s inner cool in the face of outer strife. Amid devastation in which some would give up, Andy puts his life together, piece by piece. As Andy puts it, he can either get busy living or get busy dying.\\nThe narrator is Red (Morgan Freeman), a friendly, beaten-down lifer who is continually denied parole. Red has carved out his niche as the go-to guy for outside contraband. He can get you anything, including a rock hammer and movie posters.\\nWith one look at Andy, Red bets a hefty amount of cigarettes that he\\'ll be the first of the newcomers to cry. Andy makes him lose that bet, then becomes his closest pal. The audience\\'s surrogate, Red looks on with fascinated regard as Andy sets to work making lemon merengue out of lemons.\\nAndy operates with a quiet assurance, always in control and bearing an indefatigable positive attitude. He treats every situation as though it\\'s playing into his hands. Andy exposes the weakness of greedy warden Norton (Bob Gunton), a Bible-thumper and a fascistic disciplinarian. Andy curries favor with Norton by using his accounting expertise to help him launder tax money.\\nThrough subtle cleverness, Andy earns the respect of the inmates and guards alike. He parlays his skills to help those around him, in turn helping himself.\\nWhat lingers long after a viewing of \"Shawshank\" is Andy\\'s calm resolve — his ability to form alliances, his shrewdness in working contacts and optimizing situations — but watch the film fresh and you\\'ll be surprised with the overwhelming adversity he confronts.\\nAndy is marked from the outset by the Sisters, a band of sexual predators led by Bogs (Mark Rolston), and he\\'s gang-raped multiple times. Hopes for exoneration arrive with young thief Tommy (Gil Bellows), who has information that could overturn Andy\\'s conviction. Yet the vile warden, who has come to rely on Andy\\'s presence, intervenes.\\nAndy is the walking embodiment of the Maya Angelou poem \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\" Life can rob Andy of his freedom, his physical health, even his dignity, but his resolve can\\'t be touched. Andy makes it his business to stoke his inner fire.\\nA drama informed thematically by the Alexandre Dumas novel \"The Count of Monte Cristo,\" the film is based on the Stephen King short story \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.\" Frank Darabont penned a sterling screen adaptation. Rob Reiner liked the script so much that he offered Darabont $2.5 million for the rights to direct, but Darabont chose to helm it himself.\\nDue to the seemingly tired subject matter, lack of blockbuster stars and weird title, \"Shawshank\" never caught much of a trade wind at the box office. It seemed that \"Shawshank\" might find its redemption at the Oscars, with seven nominations (including Freeman\\'s in the best-actor category and Darabont\\'s in the adapted-screenplay category), but the film was worked over at the awards, treated as unfairly as Red at his parole board hearings, shut out in the year of \"Forrest Gump.\"\\nHome video and especially cable television were much kinder, allowing the film to find its audience. TNT is said to play the movie an average of six times a year.\\nThrough Andy, Red finds his own redemption. Red seems to be a broken man, in danger of becoming institutionalized like Brooks (James Whitmore), the old-timer prison librarian. Through actions as much as words, Andy teaches Red that Red must cling to hope, if only for the ability to get by from one day to the next.\\n\"Remember, Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things,\" Andy writes Red in a resounding letter. \"And no good thing ever dies.\"\\n● Contact reporter Phil Villarreal at pvillarreal@azstarnet.com or 573-4130.\\n0 Comments on this story\\n$1 Sunday delivery - Subscribe to the Arizona Daily Star\\nEMAIL THIS STORY\\nPRINT THIS STORY\\nLETTER TO THE EDITOR\\nDISCUSS\\nCopyright © 2007\\nGo Back\\nWildcat newsletters\\nARIZONA• sign up now\\nU of A basketball coverage'},\n",

       "   'Critic': 'Search Film Freak Central Web search\\n\\npowered by FreeFind\\n\\nTHE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (1994)\\n** (out of four)\\nSUPPORT FILM FREAK CENTRAL:\\nstarring Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler\\nscreenplay by Frank Darabont, based on the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King\\ndirected by Frank Darabont\\nSPOILER WARNING IN EFFECT. There\\'s a moment in the middle of writer-director Frank Darabont\\'s newly-minted commentary track for the tenth-anniversary DVD release of The Shawshank Redemption in which he marvels at how swiftly and completely that Christian fundamentalists embraced the film (thus allying it with other modern klatch classics like Christmas with the Kranks, The Passion of the Christ, and George W. Bush). He feared, he says, that because the demonic warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is the film\\'s only overtly Christian character, the herd would flock to decry it. Apart from his shocking disingenuousness (if there\\'s a more blatant Christ parable than The Shawshank Redemption, I don\\'t know what it is), Darabont obviously doesn\\'t understand that for the reborn mind, the longer the climb, the better the proselytizing--hence the desertion, the nepotism, and the DUIs actually augmenting Dubya\\'s holiness instead of casting suspicion on it.\\nBesides, no bad deed goes unpunished in The Shawshank Redemption. It\\'s not New Testament stuff, this film; the second part of the Good Book is, after all, crammed every inch with liberal garbage like compassion and sacrifice (small wonder Christ in the Western tradition resembles a hippie). No, The Shawshank Redemption is juicy Old Testament Word, where a prison queen archetype is rewarded for raping Tim Robbins\\' neo-Christ banker (money lender!) Andy with an eye-for-an-eye savage beating, partial paralysis, and every minute until the end of his days drinking his meals through a straw. Not very Christian, this film of no forgiveness, and in a perfect world Darabont would have worried more about offending Christians with that (or the Warden\\'s celebrated suicide, or head prison guard Clancy Brown\\'s humiliating emasculation) than with the fact of one sadistic hypocrite of a bible-thumper.\\nThe film\\'s popularity is easy to understand: it parlays every single prison archetype with a level of Victorian chastity so extreme that it\\'s possible to imagine this as an early Technicolor epic shot in the waning days of the studio era. With the exception of stray blue language (which should prevent this picture, if certain right-wing fanatics forever have their way, from finding its way to network television unabridged--I\\'m looking forward to my daughter turning on the TV some Easter night to watch the unexpurgated The Passion of the Christ, though, as it doesn\\'t contain a single \"fuck\"), The Shawshank Redemption is as coy and retreating as a Doris Day melodrama, albeit one with the single-mindedness of a rape-revenge picture. (Think of Deliverance and the thrill of the piercing of the hillbilly rapist right after he has pierced Ned Beatty.) Andy the hero is wrongly accused and sent to a prison where he meets the usual suspects led by Red (Morgan Freeman), a character whose sole purpose is to marvel at Andy\\'s resilience and offer a comfortable voiceover that smoothes over the uglier aspects of the piece. When Andy\\'s getting gang-raped, for example, Red\\'s honey-warm voice assures us that he wishes he could tell us that Andy got away, but life in a prison isn\\'t a fairy tale. Except that The Shawshank Redemption is, for all intents and purposes, a fairy tale. Andy is the white knight, the warden is the evil wizard, and Red is a damsel in distress saved in the final scene with the promise of happily ever after.\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is a Norman Rockwell painting about the inside of a prison starring a Christ figure who\\'s crucified in the court of man, sent to a dark hole for a while, and reborn on the beaches of Mexico having inspired every apostle he\\'s left behind to spread the gospel of his exploits. Of course, Andy is an assistant banker who screws the man for whom he\\'s laundering bribes and extortions, flaunting the rules of man and the trust of his admittedly corrupt boss for no holier purpose than that he\\'s smarter than everyone else. Holy or not, his story appeals to us a great deal because it first offends our sense of justice, then sates our desire for vengeance with the same dogged determination Andy exhibits in slowly burrowing himself out of prison over the course of twenty years. And yet prison in The Shawshank Redemption seems rather a bucolic place once Andy has dispatched the queers and expanded the library. The homosexual element is eradicable, the race element is never a factor (Red is the only black man at Shawshank in a given medium shot), the cruel guard is domesticated with a tax tip that saves the raging bull a bundle, and the warden is publicly shamed--moreover, he\\'s encouraged to blow his mind out the back of his head before a picture of his daughter. Hurray for vigilante justice!\\nThe craft that\\'s gone into The Shawshank Redemption is, let\\'s face it, considerable. Roger Deakins\\' cinematography is a marvel, with a number of tableaux (note the final rape inside a projection booth, for instance) lit so subtly and skillfully that it doesn\\'t seem as if there\\'s any light at all but for some mysterious glow emanating from the sides of the actors\\' faces. A sequence where Andy hijacks the prison PA and pipes Mozart\\'s \"The Marriage of Figaro\" through the prison to the awe of the literally captive audience is a model of montage as well as the emotional centre of the emotional film (even if its lack of depth is exposed by a similarly-intended scene in Jules Dassin\\'s amazing 1947 prison melodrama Brute Force), while Thomas Newman\\'s soaring orchestral score captures just the right mood of overwrought and overripe. Robbins is fabulous and Freeman, as a character who can\\'t exist anywhere but within the strict framework of this type of film, refashions a cliché to create a brand new cliché unto himself. See Red again right now if you want to in Million Dollar Baby.\\nBut for all the talk of the power of hope in The Shawshank Redemption, what it preaches is a new hybrid religion extolling love with one hand while doling out punishment with the other. It\\'s about blind faith in an anointed martyr who may, in the end, just be interested in the preservation of the self and his reputation (note that Andy doesn\\'t effect his escape until he\\'s betrayed by his benefactor, the warden). And its happy ending occurs because Red has forgiven Andy for leaving him to the dogs as the one person who might have known his plan (he\\'s genuinely ignorant, but as we\\'re often reminded, these prison officials aren\\'t exactly stingy with the beatings and the sensory deprivations), and he\\'s decided not to hope, but to honour his saviour\\'s instructions to the letter at arguably the peak of his despair.\\nAwash with mixed messages and a disturbing sanctimony (bearing in mind there\\'s nothing wrong with rape/revenge flicks unless the victim is positioned as a saint/saviour unsullied by his/her debasement and fury), The Shawshank Redemption has earned its loyal following with its ability to know exactly which buttons to push in these United States. (That and the fact that it\\'s immensely entertaining--I enjoy it every single time I watch it, I just don\\'t respect it very much.) It\\'s a mirror of how the most vocal factions of modern organized Christianity have become a perverse, violent, intolerant abomination somehow capable of reading hatred and exclusion into the New Testament. What are the lessons learned by The Shawshank Redemption but that a film with neither nuance nor irony, a film shot in brilliant colour but cast in black and white, is easier to love than a film that challenges with complicated characters making the best of a complicated situation? (Like, say, Freeman\\'s own Se7en.) A month or two removed from the re-election of one of the most divisive presidents in modern memory, we locate in the ten-year-old The Shawshank Redemption a canny predictor of The Passion of the Christ\\'s success. Morality in 2004 is drawn in straight, brutal lines, and reserved, I\\'m afraid, for the anti-intellectuals in power, crippled, blinded, empowered as they are by unjustifiable victim complexes.\\n1.77:1 DVD capture: The Shawshank Redemption\\nOn a technical level, Warner\\'s Two-Disc Special Edition of The Shawshank Redemption is above reproach. The 1.77:1 anamorphic widescreen presentation is free of flaws major or minor; I looked, I really did, but I couldn\\'t spot any edge enhancement. The colours are (intentionally, I\\'d wager) saturated in the way of SATURDAY EVENING POST covers, and shadow detail in the night scenes is sharp and velvet in the same stroke. It\\'s a showcase transfer matched by a supple Dolby Digital 5.1 mix that, particularly during the rainstorm-escape but also in the bit where old con James Whitmore puts a knife to poor William Sadler\\'s throat (for my money, I like it better when Roberts Blossom cuts his hands off in Escape from Alcatraz), manages to blow the doors off the hinges from time to time.\\nAn alternate audio track features Darabont in his commentary debut, and he comes off as homey and affable, willing and eager to give due credit to his collaborators--especially Stephen King, who apparently gave him crap for making Andy\\'s escape hole too round. Sadly lost in the conversation is the idea of the rape-vengeance cycle--discussed eloquently in Carol Clover\\'s flawed but compulsively readable Men, Women, and Chain Saws--often ending with a vaginal/anal rebirth, though I liked Darabont\\'s revelations that an early cutaway to Andy\\'s hands loading a revolver is actually an insert of the director\\'s own. (It\\'s the sort of anecdote that lends depth to interpretations of the text, something along the lines of Mel Gibson\\'s being the hands that pound the nine-inch nails into Christ\\'s palms.) While Darabont can get a little obsequious to no good effect (we know that Robbins and Freeman nail their respective roles), for the most he part bolsters our respect for him in a way that his subsequent films have not. A handsome trailer rounds out Disc One.\\nThe second platter leads with Constantine Nasr\\'s \"Hope Springs Eternal: A Look Back at The Shawshank Redemption\" (31 mins.), a succession of talking-heads with key cast and crew. I was interested to hear Gil Bellows confirm that the picture is a religious experience for many, which, in all honesty, is a little frightening considering that the film is ultimately a medieval passion play--and the moral is \"follow Andy.\" That idea of a surpassing religious epiphany masquerading as a professionally-mounted estrogen melodrama starring men is continued in \"Shawshank: The Redeeming Feature\" (48 mins.), a Channel 4 documentary that includes testimonials from \"ordinary\" people about how the film changed their lives and pointed them to the path of...what? I don\\'t know--seizing the day? Getting busy living? Therein, Darabont recounts a lot of the same stories he tells in his yakker (among them Stephen King swearing that his novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption would never be adapted for the screen) while Sadler mentions that Charlie Sheen, Nicolas Cage, and Tom Cruise, for starters, were interested in the project. The participants concur that The Shawshank Redemption\\'s was the best screenplay any of them had ever read or could conceive of reading again--where do you begin to argue with something like that? A shrug is the only possible response.\\nAn episode of \"Charlie Rose\" (42 mins.) finds the venerable gabber presiding over a recent roundtable with Darabont, Freeman, and Robbins that\\'s awkward and fawning in almost the same way that any instalment of \"Inside the Actor\\'s Studio\" is, if not as well researched. Hilarity is reserved for the way that Darabont bemoans The Shawshank Redemption getting largely shut out of the 1994 Oscars because it was \"the year of Gump!\" (The films, in my mind, are pretty much interchangeable.) This is scarcely preferable to a junket roundtable, I fear, and expressly for the audience surprised to learn that Stand By Me is also based on a Stephen King novella--from the same collection! By all appearances, the guys seem to like each other a lot. Shrugging again.\\nStarring Freeman\\'s son Alfonso, Natalie Van Doren\\'s short filmThe Sharktank Redemption (25 mins.) re-imagines The Shawshank Redemption as a story set in cubicle hell. Van Doren follows the exploits of wage slaves working on the fringes of the Dream Factory as they look for little ways to rebel against the crushing inanity of publicity work, e.g. trading non-transferable party invitations, scanning Academy screeners for illegal dissemination, and working for a small collection of the world\\'s biggest assholes in the faith that the term \"no hope for advancement\" actually means \"a foot in the door.\" In the manner of a good spoof, The Sharktank Redemption understands the strengths (allegorical treatment of universal story) and weaknesses (long self-important dirge/diatribes) of its inspirations and skewers them with an affectionate persistence. The \"Marriage of Figaro\" sequence reconfigured as a mass-cc\\'d email with a list of alternative jobs is verily a stroke of genius.\\nAn animated \"Stills Gallery\" is comprised of half- to minute-long scored slideshows sorted by their emphasis on Robbins, Freeman, the supporting cast, \"Tim & Morgan,\" or \"Behind the Scenes\" (the sole gallery cracking the one-minute mark at a staggering 3 minutes). The director promises in his commentary that there will be no deleted scenes in this package because \"they\\'re not in the movie for a reason,\" something like a breath of fresh air in this age of directors appearing to love their aborted children with the same amount of fervour as they love the finished product. A \"Storyboard\" sub-menu houses \"New Fish Arrives\" (4 mins.), storyboards set to music that depict Andy arriving at Shawshank, and \"Bogs Takes a Fall\" (5 mins.), thumbnail sketches chronicling a long, unshot passage of the script. I\\'m not sure what the interest in these are, but patience is sorely tested when a text-based preface lingers onscreen a good ten seconds longer than is necessary to have read it. The final extra, a 1-minute thing called \"Shawshank Collectibles,\" is an advert for Sideshow Collectibles\\' collection of commemorative art inspired by and reproduced from the film\\'s publicity materials. Drew Struzan\\'s work is at the centre of this brief exhibition--its brevity, by the by, the only thing that keeps this commercial-masquerading-as-DVD bonus from leaving too bitter a taste in the mouth.-Walter Chaw\\n© Film Freak Central; filmfreakcentral.net.

Likewise, the last movie in which one would expect to find hope is a prison movie. However, in The Shawshank Redemption, hope is exactly what we get.\\n\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is the story of Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins); a man accused of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences. He is shipped to Shawshank Maximum Security Prison, in Shawshank, Maine, to spend the duration of his life. Over the next years (two hours, movie time), he finds his way to inner peace and holds onto great hope in the midst of the terror of the prison system.\\n\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is one of those films that is a true work of both art and magic. It is a work of art in the fact that it can so perfectly paint the picture of a man who will not relinquish the only thing someone cannot directly take away: hope. It is a work of magic in the fact that you are completely enveloped in Shawshank. From the first shot of Shawshank prison -- an utterly gothic structure that permeates you with a sense of just how frightening the prison will be -- you are enveloped inside of the world of Shawshank. You experience a prison life composed of routine after routine after routine.\\n\\nThe performances in Shawshank are top notch. The commentary upon the justice system is both thoughtful and thought provoking. Yet, despite all of its greatness, Shawshank\\'s script leaves a little to be desired. I suppose such happens when one is using Stephen King as the source for a serious movie. Shawshank\\'s characters are cliched. There is Red (Freeman), the convict who gets things, who says at one point \"I suppose there\\'s a convict like me in every prison.\" Also, Andy plays the stereotype of the innocent man, doing time for a crime he did not commit. The story is basically predictable. The dialogue has a propensity to get preachy.\\n\\nDespite these flaws, The Shawshank Redemption is a film with remarkable staying power. It is able to sustain itself throughout its duration and to keep you enraptured with its remarkably hopeful story. In the end of it all, Andy Dufrense will escape Shawshank. You will escape Shawshank. But you will not escape The Shawshank Redemption.\\n\\nThe new special edition DVD includes commentary from director Frank Darabont, two making-of documentaries, and a spoof of the film called The Sharktank Redemption, among other goodies.\\n\\nRATING (out of 5)\\n\\nDirector: Frank Darabont\\n\\nProducer: Niki Marvin\\n\\nScreenwriter: Frank Darabont\\n\\nStars: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows\\n\\nMPAA Rating: R\\nYear of Release: 1994\\nReleased on Video: 10/05/2004\\n\\nBuy The Shawshank Redemption - Special Edition on DVD from Amazon.com\\nBuy The Shawshank Redemption on DVD from Amazon.com\\nBuy The Shawshank Redemption on VHS from Amazon.com\\nBuy The Shawshank Redemption -- the Soundtrack from Amazon.com\\nBuy The Shawshank Redemption -- the Book from Amazon.com\\nRent this film on DVD\\nfrom Netflix\\nBuy this Poster from AllPosters.com\\nWant the freshest reviews?

In my defense, for the most part, neither did anyone else. When Shawshank was first released to theaters it was an abysmal failure. Despite receiving seven Oscar nominations (including Best Picture), it was a film that nobody saw. When Shawshank left theaters it appeared that Frank Darabont’s directorial debut was a failure... and then it hit home video. The next year Shawshank became the most rented film of the year. Since then the film has saturated popular culture, become a constant presence on many “Best Films of All Time” lists, and set a standard for many films to try and live up to.\\n\\nThe Movie:\\n\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is definitely a difficult sell. To hear about a dramatic story set almost entirely inside a prison isn’t exactly something most people would rush out to see. In fact, it’s easy to understand why few people saw the picture to begin with. It’s hard to convey the film’s message of hope in a trailer that only lasts a couple of minutes. It’s really a movie that requires word of mouth to encourage people to see it. So if you’re reading this, and you’re one of the few people who haven’t seen this film by now, here’s my word of mouth - put off whatever you were planning on doing tonight, pick this one up and watch it.\\n\\nShawshank is one of those rare movies that defines the whole reason I love films. It tells a fantastic story, masterfully written, acted, and directed. You can’t help but become emotionally invested in the characters and story, and because of that, the film leaves you emotionally drained by the film’s end, but still with a sense of hope.\\n\\nHope is what the film is about. Telling the story of a set of friends in Shawshank prison, the film is narrated by Red (Morgan Freeman), a prisoner who has already been in prison long enough to be rejected for parole at the beginning of the film. When newcomer Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) comes to Shawshank, Red immediately takes notice of him, and before long the two are friends. Andy is different then the other convicts within Shawshank, and not just because he’s actually innocent of the crime he’s been convicted of. That innocence is actually pretty irrelevant throughout the film. It’s also not his intelligence, although that lands him in good favors, assisting Shawshank’s warden (Bob Gunton) in embezzling money. Instead, we learn over time that the something different Andy seems to posses is a sense of hope. His hope keeps Andy driven through prison’s best and worst and his ability to hold onto that hope sets him apart from the other convicts of Shawshank.\\n\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is one of the few movies that has come out in my lifetime that I consider a “classic film”, a movie to endure the test of time. It’s the sort of movie I could watch a million times and never get tired of. Every time I watch it I am reminded of the power of hope, and reminded that if Andy could hold onto hope through twenty years of solitary confinement, prison rape, and wrongful imprisonment, then surely I can survive through a rough day at work, or a tough assignment, or an overwhelming week of overcommitment. It’s also what makes this movie extremely difficult to write about. The film just touches something inside that’s hard to describe. It has to be seen to be understood, but it’s definitely worth experiencing.\\n\\nThat inspiration isn’t the only lesson I carry with me from Shawshank though. For me there’s also a key lesson in one of the film’s more memorable lines: “It comes down to a simple choice really, get busy living, or get busy dying”. There’s a piece of advice to remember any time you hear someone mindlessly complaining about something. See, life’s too big and busy to just complain. Don’t sit and whine; If you’re unhappy, do something about it. Get busy with life, or sit and complain and prepare for your death. That’s advice to rival anything Yoda could come up with on his best day. Amazing the lessons we can learn from a simple movie, but it’s those lessons that make us want to revisit the film any time we need a reminder...\\n\\nGet busy living, or get busy dying... that’s god damn right.\\n\\nThe Disc:\\n\\nThe Shawshank Redemption has been available previously on DVD, albeit in a bare bones release. For the tenth anniversary of the little-film-that-could, the movie finally gets the treatment it deserves, from behind the scenes featurettes, to the ever so important commentary track.\\n\\nBe aware, the tenth anniversary release is available in two different forms: just the two disc set by itself, or in a Collector’s Box set. The Collector’s Box set holds nothing different on the discs, but includes the movie’s soundtrack on CD and a book that looks at the film from a more “critical report” point of view. This is no typical small, ten-page book though, it’s a full report on the movie including production pictures and interviews. The authors obviously did their homework on the movie, and while it’s not the most interesting read throughout, it is interesting to view the movie through such a critical eye. If you like the movie’s soundtrack though, that alone is what’s worth the price of the set - to have both the film and soundtrack in the same box. Regardless of which version you purchase, the two disc set remains the same.\\n\\nThe most interesting part of the DVD is the one thing that’s almost expected from any DVD release these days - the commentary track. Frank Darabont announces at the beginning that this is his first commentary track and asks us to take it easy on him. Well, I’m not going to take it easy. Darabont’s insightful views on his directorial debut grab you and keep you listening to the commentary long after you might usually turn a commentary track off. It’s not unusual to only listen to a sample of a commentary track when reviewing a DVD, listening long enough to get a feel for what the “flavor” of the track is. Darabont’s commentary held me through the entire film, and then I wanted to go back and listen to it again. I wanted to hear more of what the man had to say about making this film.\\n\\nOften it’s easy to criticize commentary tracks of “kissing ass” of the people involved in making the movie. Although Darabont has a pleasant thing to say about everyone involved, every single bit of it feels sincere. He goes out of his way to point out how each of these fantastic people affected the film, and you get the feeling he knows the film is great because of the accomplishments of every one involved. Darabont, as a director, knows that although the responsibility of telling the story lies in his hands, the knowledge of how to best tell the story may not be in his abilities - especially for his first film. He points out information that normally would have gone unseen, rants about the problems he had with the Humane Society, and gives some insight to breaking into Hollywood and directing in general. Darabont also explains other missing aspects of the DVD release, such as the lack of deleted scenes, which he knows were deleted for a reason, and likens sharing them with an audience to sharing his dirty underwear. I think part of the reason Darabont’s commentary is so good is that he didn’t feel the need to immediately record his thoughts on this movie. He waited until time had passed, perhaps to weed out the weaker memories that weren’t as important, or perhaps so the movie was fresh to him again. Regardless of the reason, I hope he gives his other movies as great a treatment as he does this film, even if it means waiting ten years for each film.\\n\\nThere are two behind the scenes featurettes, three if you include the recent interview with Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and Frank Darabont on “The Charlie Rose Show”. Both the interview and the featurettes offer the viewpoints of the people responsible for the movie, from producers to cast, and their feelings on both the movie and its eventual success. The two featurettes do have a tendency to use the same footage throughout their almost hourlong lengths, both from the film and from interviews. They are both worth watching, but because of the redundancies it’s probably best to space them apart when watching them.\\n\\nAlso included on the DVD release is one of the greatest film parodies of all time, The Sharktank Redemption, which mirrors the tale told in the prison of Shawshank with the story of interns in a Hollywood agency. The most remarkable thing about the parody is the dead likeness they manage to get for the actor mirroring Morgan Freeman’s Red... and there’s a reason for that. The actor portraying Fred Redding is Alfonso Freeman, Morgan Freeman’s son. Alfonso actually was in Shawshank, in a brief on-screen appearance as well as in Red’s prison file picture (as a younger version of Red). In Sharktank he masterfully mimics his father’s narrative skills, and brings the parody almost as much life in half an hour as the full length movie gets in it’s full length. Of course, this is mainly because of the foundation of Shawshank, but it’s still a fun little film worth watching a time or two.\\n\\nThere are some still galleries, which play by themselves to some of the Shawshank theme music, and storyboards as well. I would be remiss if I didn’t also point out that the theatrical trailer is also included, something I’m usually quick to point out if missing.\\n\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is definitely a classic film that will be remembered for years to come. It’s a must own, and this is the version to own - finally a version that gives you more then just the movie to chew on. If you’ve seen Shawshank you already know the power of the movie. If you haven’t, pick this up soon. Its inspirational message may just bring some much needed hope into your life.\\n\\nThumbnails Gallery for The Shawshank Redemption - Tenth Anniversary Edition\\n \\n  Comment on “The Shawshank Redemption - Tenth Anniversary Edition”\\nNote: Comments that are not polite and free of profanity will not be published.

       "   'Critic': \"FILM\\nMUSIC\\nTV\\nVIDEO\\nFEATURES\\nNEWS\\nGAMES\\nTHEATER\\nBOOKS\\nDONATE\\nFILM\\nReview: The Shawshank Redemption\\nThe appeal of Frank Darabont’s film isn’t exactly inexplicable.\\nby Ed Gonzalez\\nOctober 16, 2004 2\\nAbout a month before The Shawshank Redemption was released in theaters, director Frank Darabont showed the film to a crowd of film students at NYU. After the screening, a student surprised Darabont by saying he was insulted by the depiction of the “butch queer” Sisters posse that repeatedly rapes Tim Robbins in the film. Though the student was ceremoniously shot down by the teary-eyed (mostly straight) crowd, a sensitive Darabont managed a semi-apologetic response, pointing out that he had dedicated the film to his former agent Allan Greene, who helped Darabont get the directing gig at Castle Rock Entertainment but who died of AIDS shortly before the film finished shooting. I dismissed it then, but I should have known that Shawshank Redemption would become as beloved as it is now, ranking alongside other overrated “classics” like Casablanca, Schindler’s List, and the genuinely terrible Star Wars as one of the greatest movies of all time (on IMDb’s Top 250 list, the film currently ranks #3).\\nThe appeal of the film isn’t exactly inexplicable. Where Douglas Sirk and George Cukor made melodramas (“women’s pictures”), and directors like Robert Aldrich and John Huston often made rock-solid noirs (“men’s pictures”), Darabont does something in between, ingeniously (at least from a marketing perspective) crafting films for “the sensitive straight man” (you know: that strange breed of heterosexual dudes who don’t have a problem telling a roomful of people they’re about to “pinch a loaf” but are careful to leave an empty seat between themselves and male friends when they go to the movies together). Films like Twentynine Palms use the sensation of horror to plumb our country’s hang-ups with sex and violence, whereas a film like Shawshank Redemption hides Big Issues behind cheap melodrama and noirish shadows. It’s prison life as directed from inside a closet.\\nBased on the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, Darabont’s film follows what happens to Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) after he’s sent to prison for killing his wife and lover. From the soapy courtroom theatrics that open the picture to Andy’s prison escape (how’s that for a dramatic overhead!) and fuzzy-wuzzy reunion with Ellis Boyd “Red” Redding (Morgan Freeman) in Mexico, the film announces itself as Beaches for straight men. King’s best stories, including his brilliant It, are bathed in the glow of adolescent innocence and sexual desire. It’s an aesthetic and emotional philosophy Darabont understands and respects but erroneously applies to a story set inside a prison. Unlike the best prison dramas (like, say, Bresson’s A Man Escaped, Jean Genet’s Un chant d’amour, or any episode of Oz), sentimental twaddle like Shawshank Redemption (admittedly a few steps above a stinking pile of shit like The Last Castle) says zilch about life behind bars and human interaction.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nI don’t mean to be cynical, but isn’t prison life supposed to be a little less nostalgic than this? Shawshank Redemption is supposed to be a drama, but it’s pitched somewhere between an intense thrill ride and romantic buddy comedy. When the evil Captain Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) almost threatens to throw Andy off a roof, Darabont captures the moment with a dramatic overhead. Later, when the old man played by James Whitmore is paroled and discovers that he’s lonely on the outside, he hangs himself in a halfway house. The moment would be touching if Red’s trite narration didn’t imply that life in prison isn’t so bad after all. Freeman and Robbins are excellent performers, but just as the latter is forced to play a hollow saint, the former is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the story’s trite Hallmark-isms. Red’s race and social anxieties never register, and the one time he plays the role of “angry Black man,” he’s dutifully rewarded (how’s that for irony?) with a get-out-of-jail card.\\n“Your ass belongs to me,” says the evil warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) when Andy arrives at Shawshank. Clearly Bogs Diamond (Mark Rolston) follows the same mantra. Twenty minutes into the film, when Andy walks into the mess hall, Bogs pops up his head and looks at the fresh-faced newcomer like a vulture that’s spotted fresh meat…or the love of his life. Naturally, it’s only a matter time before the redheaded leader of the Sisters gang fucks Andy in the ass. Except right before Bogs gives it to Andy, Darabont’s camera politely pans away. “I wish I could tell you Andy fought the good fight…and the Sisters let him be. I wish I could tell you that…but prison is no fairy-tale world,” says Red over narration. The irony here is that prison is a spit-and-polished fairy-tale for Darabont, who would rather linger on an old man feeding a worm to a sick little bird than truly confront us with the humanity of an unjust world.\\nDarabont’s version of King’s story is gimmicky and schematic and panders to our most contrived sexual anxieties and base notions of revenge and guerrilla justice. By film’s end, the heroic Andy has not only escaped prison, but every villain has been punished. Darabont’s lead characters in Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, and The Majestic all bring to mind classic James Stewart roles from It’s a Wonderful Life and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Shawshank Redemption is drenched in movie nostalgia, but the story’s fixation with movies and starlets like Raquel Welch and Rita Hayworth doesn’t mean anything. Just as posters in the film disguise plot twists, the film’s naïve sentimentality undermines serious issues of violence, rape, manhood, and male bonding. Indeed, after the Sisters are silenced, Darabont cranks up the unilateral act of hero worship: prison goes from being “mean and scary” to, well, “cute.” Andy writes letters in order to get books into the prison library, starts doing everyone’s taxes, and wins the hearts of guards and prisoners alike. Someone should bake a pie. Oh, wait, they do!\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nScore:   Cast: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, Mark Rolston, James Whitmore  Director: Frank Darabont  Screenwriter: Frank Darabont  Distributor: Columbia Pictures  Running Time: 142 min  Rating: R  Year: 1994  Buy: Video, Soundtrack\\nIf you can, please consider supporting Slant Magazine.\\n\\nSince 2001, we've brought you uncompromising, candid takes on the world of film, music, television, video games, theater, and more.

Perhaps it was the murkiness of this distinction that resulted in the film\\'s underwhelming break-even grosses when it The Shawshank Redemption Directed by; Frank Darabont Written by: Darabont, based on a story by Stephen King Starring: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler At: Boston Common Running time: 144 minutes Rated: R (language, prison violence) y2 was originally released. But word got out eventually, as \"Shawshank\" went on to become a video chart topper, and is now being showcased with today\\'s lOth-anni-versary theatrical reissue and an more than extras-packed DVD due Oct 5. Tim Robbins stars as Andy Du-fresne, a successful young banker falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He\\'s packed off to oppressively bleak Shawshank Prison, which despite the story\\'s 1940s setting confronts him with all manner of tunelessly hellacious cellblock perils.\\nLuckily and crucially for Andy, there\\'s shrewd but good-hearted longtime inmate Red (best actor nominee Morgan Freeman) to help see him through. Andy is intermittently hopeful that he can somehow prove his innocence, and responds dutifully when Shawshank\\'s stern warden enlists his business skills to handle the prison\\'s books. But as it slowly, agonizingly grows clear to Andy escapist fare that he\\'s being railroaded yet again, he finds the strength in himself to take action, and to inspire hope in Red along the way. It\\'s a simple story elegantly, cleverly told, not to mention expertly acted. As good as Robbins was in nabbing an Oscar for \"Mystic River,\" he exceeded that work with this performance, his face a beleaguered etching of determination staving off despair.\\nIf s a wonder that Robbins didnt join Freeman on the list of best actor nominees not to mention that the film was shut out at the Oscars despite nods for best picture and best adapted screenplay.

Frank Darabont\\'s debut is adored, praised as literally life-changing by some, and so impressive that people are even prepared to forgive its writer-director for The Majestic. Now, after making its reputation on home video, the powerful drama - about two convicts (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) whose friendship is forged in America\\'s most unforgiving prison - receives a welcome anniversary re-release.\\nIt\\'s simple to say The Shawshank Redemption is about hope, but it is also about faith and love. In an age and culture saturated with sex, it allows for a close relationship unburdened by bodily fluids. Enigmatic new inmate Andy (Robbins) and the regretful, older Red (Freeman) could hardly contrast more, yet they connect. They love each other. That neither actor nabbed an Oscar in the year Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump shows stupid is as stupid does, indeed. Freeman, in particular, is exceptional. His performance is so unshowy it can easily go unnoticed, but it\\'s the soul of Shawshank.\\n\"MOVING, WARM AND REWARDING\"\\nThe script - based on a Stephen King short story - is grounded in prison movie cliché: from Bob Gunton\\'s grim-faced, Bible-spouting warden (\"Put your trust in the Lord; your ass belongs to me\") to James Whitmore\\'s wizened old bird fancier. And, yes, the beach-set postscript (filmed at the studio\\'s suggestion) feels slightly overstretched. But the characters are so engrossing, their plight so pitiable, that these issues don\\'t detract from the picture\\'s impact (just as it takes repeat viewings to notice how implausible the ending is). Moving, warm and rewarding, The Shawshank Redemption deserves its release.\\nEnd Credits\\nDirector: Frank Darabont\\nWriter: Frank Darabont\\nStars: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, James Whitmore, Clancy Brown\\nGenre: Drama\\nLength: 142 minutes\\nOriginal: 1994\\nCinema: 17 September 2004\\nCountry: USA\\nCinema Search\\nWhere can I see this film?\\nselect region\\nBedfordshire\\nBerkshire\\nBirmingham & surrounds\\nBristol & Bath\\nBuckinghamshire\\nCambridgeshire\\nChannel Islands\\nCheshire\\nCornwall\\nCounty Durham\\nCumbria\\nDerbyshire\\nDevon\\nDorset\\nEast Sussex\\nEast Riding of Yorkshire\\nEssex\\nGloucestershire\\nManchester & Greater Manchester\\nHampshire\\nHereford & Worcester\\nHertfordshire\\nIsle of Man\\nIsle of Wight\\nKent\\nLancashire\\nLeicestershire & Rutland\\nLincolnshire\\nCentral London\\nEast London\\nNorth London\\nSouth London\\nWest London\\nMerseyside\\nMiddlesex\\nNorfolk\\nNorth Yorkshire\\nNorthamptonshire\\nNorthumberland\\nNottinghamshire\\nOxfordshire\\nShropshire\\nSomerset\\nSouth Yorkshire\\nStaffordshire\\nSuffolk\\nSurrey\\nTeesside\\nTyne & Wear\\nWarwickshire\\nWest Sussex\\nWest Yorkshire\\nWiltshire\\nBelfast & Antrim\\nDown & Armagh\\nFermanagh, Tyrone & Derry\\nArgyll & Bute\\nCentral, Angus & Fife\\nGlasgow & Ayrshire\\nHighlands & Islands\\nEdinburgh & Lothian\\nNorth East Scotland\\nBorders & South\\nNE Wales\\nNW Wales\\nMid Wales\\nSW Wales\\nSE Wales\\nNew Releases\\nIron Man\\nMade of Honor\\nNim\\'s Island\\nP2\\nJoy Division\\nTovarisch I Am Not Dead\\nRate This Film\\nHow was it for you?\\n   1\\n   2\\n   3\\n   4\\n   5\\nAverage rating:\\n5 from 2341 votes\\nYour Reviews\\nGo on, be the first user to review this film\\nRead all of your comments\\nFILMS Links\\nThe Shawshank Redemption 10th Anniversary SE DVD review\\nWeb Links\\nFind out more about \"The Shawshank Redemption\" at:\\nMovie Review Query Engine\\nThe Internet Movie Database\\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external websites\\nArchive of chats with directors and stars...\\nArchive of reviews ending\\n2 May 2008...\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout the BBC | Help | Terms of Use | Privacy & Cookies Policy\\n '},\n",

       "   'Critic': 'widget @ surfing-waves.com\\n\\n\\nArchive\\nVolume 0\\n#1 - 10\\nApril 10, 1995 - June 13, 1995\\n\\nall movies are graded out of four stars ()\\n#10 June 13, 1995 by Michael Dequina\\n\\nM O V I E S\\nPocahontas (G)\\nIt would be easy to dismiss Disney\\'s 33rd animated feature as a disappointment. And it is--not as playful and crowd-pleasing as Aladdin or The Little Mermaid, not as thematically resonant as The Lion King, nor as all-around brilliant as Beauty and the Beast. However, it is only disappointing if one expects the traditional Disney fare, for the studio has rewritten all the rules with Pocahontas, a surprisingly understated and mature romantic drama that just happens to be animated.\\nFor those who have managed to miss the hype, Pocahontas centers around the eponymous Native American heroine (spoken by Irene Bedard, sung by Judy Kuhn) who helped bring peace between her people and the British settlers in 17th century America. The emotional core of the film is her romance with settler John Smith (Mel Gibson).\\nThe quasi-historical basis of the film sets it apart from the fantasy and whimsy that usually dominates Disney animated features, and the animators further set it apart through their drawing style. The colors are not as vibrant, yet bright enough to keep it somewhat detached from reality. Pocahontas is unlike any other Disney heroine in many ways, the most striking distinction being an unabashed sensuousness.\\nThe story unfolds at a relaxed pace, which may turn off the wee ones (the smaller children were obviously antsy during the screening I attended). But the pace allows the story to breathe and the romance to grow at a more natural, less hurried pace. One of the more surprising techniques used by the usually overstated Disney is the reliance on expression and silence. Pocahontas and John Smith first meet in silence, their eyes and faces telling the whole story. Also surprising is the duration of their big kiss; their lips are allowed to linger together longer than probably most children would like. The requisite comic relief comes in the form of Meeko, a raccoon; Flit, a hummingbird; and Percy, a dog. While their silent antics are funny, not to mention pleasing to the kiddies, they can\\'t help but feel randomly thrown in to soften the serious dramatic proceedings.\\nThe music by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz is less pop-driven than previous Disney films and more Broadway, and is more effective as a result. \"Just Around the Riverbend,\" the traditional hero \"I Want\" song, gets into Pocahontas\\'s personality about as well as \"Belle\" in Beauty and \"Part of Your World\" in Mermaid. The sequence in the film is truly striking, with Pocahontas rowing through an increasingly turbulent river (a wonderfully subtle metaphor for the journey she takes in the film). The big showstopper in the film is not a big production number à la \"Under the Sea,\" \"Be Our Guest,\" or \"Friend Like Me\"; in accordance with this film\\'s totally different tone, showstopper honors go to Pocahontas\\'s sweeping anthem \"Colors of the Wind,\" which will go down in history as one of the best Disney tunes ever and is a virtual lock to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song next year. Judy Kuhn does a fabulous job as Pocahontas\\'s singing voice, and Mel Gibson actually isn\\'t half bad with what little singing is required of him. The only flaw in the score is what isn\\'t there--namely, a love duet between Pocahontas and John Smith. Incidentally, \"If I Never Knew You,\" the couple\\'s love theme sung by Kuhn and Gibson, was cut from the film after children in test audiences were getting antsy, for it came late in the film. I think that since Disney is obviously taking a more mature approach with this film, they should have kept it in; while the love story doesn\\'t lose anything in its absence, I believe the two earned the chance to pledge their love in song after all is said and done (a pop version of the cut song sung by Jon Secada and Shanice plays during the end credits).\\nPocahontas marks a major turning point in the history of Disney animated features--it tells a story that does not necessarily lend itself to the medium. Its mature appeal makes it less kid-friendly--and, to a certain extent, less \"fun\"--than the previous features, but it is still a moving piece of work. From the opening shot of a painting of a ship to the closing shot of one of our heroine looking at a ship setting sail, Pocahontas, while probably not a box office blockbuster, is another artistic triumph for the Disney animation division.\\n\\nV I D E O\\nDisclosure (R)\\nBarry Levinson\\'s entertaining adaptation of Michael Crichton\\'s sexual harassment thriller stars Michael Douglas as the victim and a wonderfully bitchy Demi Moore as the victimizer. (Warner Home Video)\\n\\nDrop Zone (R)\\nWesley Snipes stars in this reasonably exciting action thriller about a U.S. Marshal (Snipes) who infiltrates a group of drug-dealing skydivers. Added irony: Gary Busey as an ex-DEA agent. Director John Badham keeps everything moving at a quick pace although he ventures into outright John Woo ripoff in the final act. Snipes is as great as usual. (Paramount Home Video)\\n\\nPrêt-à-Porter (Ready to Wear) (R)\\nThe \"official\" title of Robert Altman\\'s largely unfunny satire of the fashion world is Ready to Wear (Prêt-à-Porter), but the five people (including myself) who actually saw this mess in theaters knows the actual title is the French one (seen in very large letters), not the English translation (seen in tiny type). This is one of Altman\\'s trademark ensemble pieces with interlocking characters and stories; the problem is only one story is amusing (Julia Roberts and Tim Robbins as reporters forced to share a hotel room) and only one character is truly memorable (a ditzy fashion reporter played by Kim Basinger, who should have received an Oscar nomination for her hilarious performance). Sophia Loren, Marcello Mastroianni (whose storyline goes absolutely nowhere), Lyle Lovett, Lauren Bacall, and Forest Whitaker are also among the stars trapped in this sporadically amusing camp mess. (Miramax Home Entertainment)\\n\\n\\n#9 June 6, 1995 by Michael Dequina\\n\\nV I D E O\\nInterview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (R)\\nA box office and artistic disappointment in which Tom Cruise stars as the vampire Lestat, Brad Pitt as tortured vampire Louis, and Kirsten Dunst as their young charge, Claudia. Anne Rice loved this adaptation of her popular novel, but many moviegoers and Rice purists were left cold. The acting is a mixed bag: Cruise makes an admirable stretch as the androgynous, seductive Lestat, and Dunst blows her co-stars away with an Oscar-worthy performance; however, Pitt is truly awful, sleepwalking through his role. The only one who comes off even worse is Stephen Rea, totally lost as the vampire Santiago. Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater are fairly adequate as vampire Armand and the interviewer, respectively. A borderline effort from director Neil Jordan. (Warner Home Video)\\n\\nJunior (PG)\\nCute, amusing, but never hilarious farce about a pregnant man (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Schwarzenegger reunites with Twins director Ivan Reitman and co-star Danny DeVito for only mild results. Emma Thompson steals the show as a clumsy scientist. (MCA/Universal Home Video)\\n\\n\\n#8 May 31, 1995 by Michael Dequina\\n\\nM O V I E S\\nBraveheart (R)\\nMel Gibson gives a passionate performance both in front of and behind the camera with this sweeping historical epic about legendary Scottish hero William Wallace (Gibson), who rallied Scotsmen against English rule. The film is full of electrifying battle sequences that literally involve a cast of thousands. To director Gibson\\'s credit, nothing is romanticized--the violence is unflinchingly brutal and bloody. But while the violence is raw, so are the emotions, and the film packs quite a punch, especially in heart-rending climax--a scene of such astonishing emotional resonance that it blew me away. Braveheart clocks in at nearly three hours, and Randall Wallace\\'s screenplay doesn\\'t have enough compelling momentum to keep the audience from feeling the length. Still, the running time is justified--I cannot see where it could have been cut. A triumph for Mel Gibson, who has a bright future in the directing arena.\\n\\nV I D E O\\nLegends of the Fall (R)\\nBrad Pitt inexplicably became a major star after his unimpressive performance in this glorified soap opera about three brothers (Pitt, Aidan Quinn, and E.T.\\'s Henry Thomas) fighting over one woman (Julia Ormond). Ormond is the only one who turns in a decent performance; not even Anthony Hopkins, as the family\\'s patriarch, is immune to the bad acting bug that strickens Pitt, Quinn, Thomas, and almost all of the cast. I like a good soap opera as much as the next person, but this one, filled with pseudo-mystical mumbo-jumbo about \"the bear,\" is much too hokey to be enjoyed, even by soap standards. (Columbia TriStar Home Video).\\n\\nA Low Down Dirty Shame (R)\\nA mildly amusing action comedy with Keenen Ivory Wayans (who also wrote and directed) as a down-and-out private eye. Jada Pinkett steals the show as his spunky sidekick. The comedy is hit-or-miss, while Wayans proves to be a huge fan of Hong Kong action flicks, ripping off a number of action sequences from them--some sequences and stylistic flourishes (like freeze frames) are directly lifted from John Woo; a character is named Chow Yung-Fat (as opposed to Chow Yun-Fat), and the shopping mall finale more than recalls the ending of Jackie Chan\\'s Police Story. (Hollywood Pictures Home Video)\\n\\n\\n#7 May 22, 1995 by Michael Dequina\\n\\nM O V I E S\\nDie Hard with a Vengeance (R)\\nBruce Willis is back and better than ever as John McClane in this third installment of the immensely popular action series. This time, McClane goes after a mad bomber (a very effective Jeremy Irons) in New York with the help of a reluctant partner (Samuel L. Jackson, whose spirited line delivery more than recalls his portrayal of Jules in Pulp Fiction). Jonathan Hensleigh\\'s script is disjointed and is the weak glue that holds together the stunts and explosions, but director John McTiernan (rebounding after the odious Last Action Hero) pulls the stunts off with such finesse that the script problems are almost irrelevant (except for one final plot point that takes a huge leap in logic and the underwhelming finale). The stars and McTiernan make a very entertaining piece of action entertainment, although one not nearly as effective as the cat-and-mouse claustrophobia of McTiernan\\'s original or the exhilarating excesses of Renny Harlin\\'s Die Hard 2: Die Harder. Note to PF fans: stay alert for the obligatory PF reference, one only the biggest PF fans, like myself, will catch.\\n\\nV I D E O\\nClerks. (R)\\nFirst-time writer-director Kevin Smith took the national critics by storm last year with this hilarious black-and-white comedy about two slacker clerks (Brian O\\'Halloran and Jeff Anderson), one who works at a convenience store, the other at a video store. Fresh, funny, and made for only $28,000. (Miramax Home Entertainment)\\n\\nHeavenly Creatures (R)\\nOne of the most genuinely disturbing films I have ever seen. This drama from New Zealand tells shocking true story of two teens (played to chilling perfection by Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey) whose obsessive friendship leads them to brutally murder one of their mothers. Director Peter Jackson (best known for the tongue-in-cheek horror flick Dead-Alive) creates a rich, haunting atmosphere, deftly juggling the eerily giddy fantasy world of the girls (complete with lifesize, animated clay figures) and their harsh, violent reality. Jackson and co-scripter Frances Walsh were Academy Award nominees for Best Original Screenplay. (Miramax Home Entertainment)\\n\\n\\n#6 May 15, 1995 by Michael Dequina\\n\\nM O V I E S\\nCrimson Tide (R)\\nThe first big blockbuster of the summer. Oscar-winners Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman give incredible performances in this tense submarine thriller. What the film lacks in slam-bang action it more than makes up for in sheer suspense. Great work from everyone involved, from Washington and Hackman to director Tony Scott, credited screenwriter Michael Schiffer, and uncredited script doctors Robert Towne, Steven Zaillian (Schindler\\'s List), and, yes, Quentin Tarantino, who contributes some great lines and character quirks.\\n\\nV I D E O\\nThe Professional (R)\\nFrench writer-director Luc Besson is a major talent (see La Femme Nikita), but you would never know from this stylish, promising, but ultimately boring and unsettling thriller about a hitman (uncharismatic Jean Reno, also from Nikita) who takes an orphaned girl (newcomer Natalie Portman, in a very impressive debut performance) under his wing. After a dazzling opening sequence, this one goes downhill fast, thanks to very little action and unsettling pedophilic overtones. (Columbia TriStar Home Video)\\n\\n\\n#5 May 8, 1995 by Michael Dequina\\n\\nM O V I E S\\nFrench Kiss (PG-13)\\nMeg Ryan and Kevin Kline have chemistry to burn, but it goes to waste in Lawrence Kasdan\\'s surprisingly slow romantic comedy. Ryan is as charming as ever as an American woman searching for her fiance (an adequate Timothy Hutton) in France with the help of a shady French thief (Kline, who is great as usual). After a promising start, the film slows to a crawl during its lagging midsection, only to pick up during the last half hour, but it all comes too late. The frothy confection is all very easy to swallow, but this stew can\\'t help but feel somewhat tepid coming so soon after the far superior While You Were Sleeping.\\n\\nV I D E O\\nMary Shelley\\'s Frankenstein (R)\\nThe most underrated movie of last year. Granted, Kenneth Branagh\\'s take on the horror classic is a little slow and never scary, but it is an oddly moving father-son love story between the obsessed doctor (Branagh) and his creation (well-played by Robert DeNiro). A huge flop last fall, this one should find an audience on video. Merchant Ivory regular Helena Bonham Carter also stars as Dr. Frankenstein\\'s adoptive sister/fiancée. (Columbia TriStar Home Video)\\n\\n\\n#4 May 1, 1995 by Michael Dequina\\n\\nM O V I E S\\nDestiny Turns on the Radio (R)\\nQuentin Tarantino is one \"bad motherfucker.\" But not even he can save this pointless and utterly baffling \"romantic adventure of mystical proportion\" about an escaped convict (Dylan McDermott) trying to get back with his lounge singer girlfriend (a lip-synching Nancy Travis). Tarantino, by far the film\\'s best asset, is wasted in the role of magical gambler Johnny Destiny, whose only apparent purpose is to give the film its title and serve as an excuse for some less-than-impressive visual effects. But at least he and Jim Belushi, as a crotch-grabbing gangster casino owner, appear to be having any fun throughout the campy proceedings. If the thin script by Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone (which was developed at Robert Redford\\'s prestigious Sundance Institute, no less) was able to attract Tarantino\\'s attention, then there\\'s hope yet for my screenplay. I just hope that ol\\' Quentino was paid well for his trouble in what is really a glorified cameo role.\\n\\n\\n#3 April 24, 1995 by Michael Dequina\\n\\nM O V I E S\\nKiss of Death (R)\\nEvents happen so quickly at the beginning of this crime thriller that you wish things would slow down a bit so you could get all the characters and events straight. But sure enough, thirty minutes and a \"three years later\" disclaimer later, things sloooooow down, crawling to an incredibly unsatisfying finish. Be careful what you wish for. Despite strong performances by NYPD Blue refugee David Caruso (as an ex-crook attempting to go straight), a woefully underused Helen Hunt (as Caruso\\'s wife), Samuel L. Jackson (as a tough cop that helps Caruso), and especially a pumped-up Nicolas Cage (as the local crime boss), this atmospheric yet ultimately hollow exercise in tedium is a major letdown from director Barbet Schroeder, who last directed the terrific Single White Female.\\n\\nWhile You Were Sleeping (PG)\\nDemolition Man made her noticed. Speed put her on the map. Now, lovely and talented Sandra Bullock should become a superstar with this charming and funny romantic comedy. Bullock plays a lonely transit worker who falls in love with a man in a coma (engagingly played by Peter Gallagher), only to eventually fall for his brother (Bill Pullman). Never before has the normally sleepwalking Pullman been used so adequately, actually displaying great chemistry with Bullock. It may not be an \"important\" movie, but Sleeping is a welcome ray of sunshine in this current dreary movie season.\\n\\nV I D E O\\nForrest Gump (PG-13)\\nThe worthy winner of six Academy Awards including Best Picture, Robert Zemeckis\\'s tale of a simpleton\\'s (Tom Hanks) incredible journey through thirty years of American history was the most beloved film of last year. Tom Hanks rightfully won his second consecutive Best Actor Oscar for what can simply be called one of the best performances in film history. He receives outstanding support from Best Supporting Actor nominee Gary Sinise, Sally Field, Mykelti Williamson, and especially Robin Wright, who not only should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actress, but should have won. A great film. (Paramount Home Video)\\n\\nTerminal Velocity (R)\\nIncredibly campy action thriller with Charlie Sheen as a former Olympic gymnast (I kid you not) turned daredevil skydiver who gets tangled with a \"K-G-used-to-be\" agent (Nastassja Kinski, who\\'s actually the real action hero of the film). Not exciting enough to be a Die Hard, not funny enough to be a Hot Shots! film either. (Hollywood Pictures Home Video)\\n\\n\\n#2 April 17, 1995by Michael Dequina\\n\\nV I D E O\\nEd Wood (R)\\nA hilarious and enormously entertaining biopic of Edward D. Wood Jr. (Johnny Depp), widely considered the worst film director of all time. The cast is uniformly outstanding, including Bill Murray, Patricia Arquette, and Martin Landau, who deservedly won the Supporting Actor Oscar for his uncanny portrayal of Bela Lugosi. (Touchstone Home Video)\\n\\nQuiz Show (PG-13)\\nRobert Redford\\'s Oscar-nominated document of the 1950s quiz show scandal does boast a marvelous performance by Ralph Fiennes (who plays contestant Charles Van Doren) and a provocative storyline, but it is by far last year\\'s single most overrated film. The film drags on many occasions, and Rob Morrow gives a truly embarrassing performance as the investigator who looks into the rigged quiz shows. This film is widely held as Redford\\'s best film as director; if that\\'s the case, then he maybe isn\\'t that great of a director after all. (Hollywood Pictures Home Video)\\n\\n\\n#1 April 10, 1995 by Michael Dequina\\n\\nM O V I E S\\nBad Boys (R)\\nMartin Lawrence and Will Smith star in this crowd-pleasing, energetic action comedy. The flimsy plot involving thieves (led by overacting French actor Tcheky Karyo of La Femme Nikita) who steal confiscated heroin and a witness (Téa Leoni) to a murder is fairly pedestrian, but the exuberance and chemistry between the stars keep the vehicle afloat. Director Michael Bay gives the visuals an appealing gloss and stages all of the requisite car chases and explosions pretty well, but visual razzle-dazzle can\\'t disguise the fact that the story is so familiar. Lawrence gets the most laughs while Smith is a credible straight man. An entertaining package that should be a huge hit.\\n\\nOutbreak (R)\\nEntertaining medical thriller that suffers from lapses in credibility as it approaches its conclusion. The top-flight cast including Dustin Hoffman, Rene Russo, and Morgan Freeman turn in solid performances, and director Wolfgang Petersen keeps things at a brisk pace and packs the film full of exciting, if not implausible, action scenes.\\n\\nV I D E O\\nLove Affair (PG-13)\\nEgocentric Warren Beatty and a wasted Annette Bening star in this tepid remake of 1939\\'s Love Affair, which was already remade in 1955\\'s An Affair to Remember, to which 1993\\'s Sleepless in Seattle payed homage. Did I mention those three films are better? (Warner Home Video)\\n\\nThe Shawshank Redemption (R)\\nNominated for 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Shawshank tells the tale of the friendship between two convicts serving life sentences (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman). Flawlessly acted and directed, this film packed the strongest emotional wallop out of any film last year. Kind of formulaic, but no less rewarding.

       "   'Critic': \"Laramie Movie Scope:\\nThe Shawshank Redemption\\nA classic story from Stephen King\\nby Robert Roten, Film Critic\\nOctober 25, 1994 -- ``The Shawshank Redemption,'' as noted above, is a standard beginning-to-end movie. The dialogue, based on a Stephen King story, is not as sharp as in ``Pulp Fiction,'' but it does have what ``Pulp Fiction'' lacked. Characters worth caring about and who actually learn something about themselves as the film progresses.\\nThe film deals with two convicted murderers in prison, Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, and ``Red'' Redding, played by Morgan Freeman. As the story unfolds, it turns out that Dufresne was wrongly convicted, but is forced to stay in prison because he, a former banker, has become too important to the warden's illegal money laundering schemes.\\nAs the film unwinds, the two men become fast friends. Both find ways to cope with the horror of prison life in the 1950s and 1960s and both eventually even dare to hope.\\nDirector/writer Frank Darabont brings considerable passion to the prison reform message in the story. The characters are very well developed and Freeman and Robbins both are outstanding in their leading roles. Veteran actor James Whitmore is also excellent in a supporting role as the prison librarian.\\nThe film is also very well photographed by Roger Deakins. The production values, in fact, are all first-rate. This is a fine, moving film.

       "   'Critic': '  The Shawshank Redemption\\nDirected By: Frank Darabont\\nWritten By: Stephen King (short story) & Frank Darabont (screenplay)\\nStarring: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler\\nPlot Summary - Review 1 - Review 2 - CURRENT REVIEWS\\nHOME: movies.zertinet.com\\nAndy Dufresne is a young and successful banker whose life changes drastically when he is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. Set in the 1940\\'s, the film shows how Andy, with the help of his friend Red, the prison entrepreneur, turns out to be a most unconventional prisoner.[TRAILER]\\nSTEVEN SNYDER\\'S REVIEW\\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is most memorable thanks to its ingenious surprises. Repeatedly, its story is told through misdirection. We think a scene is about subject A, when in fact it is both about B and foreshadowing C. We find ourselves amazed at how much is simultaneously occurring and overwhelmed by an ending no one expects.\\nIt is a seminal collaboration of storytellers, actors and filmmakers intent on keeping the film\\'s real motivations and real pleasures hidden until the last possible moment. And behind it all, as audiences are kept off balance, exist characters and emotions so richly textured and developed that \"The Shawshank Redemption\" becomes a mosaic of breathtaking sincerity. No wonder that fans of the film can point to so many different parts of this masterpiece as their favorite, and all be correct.\\nThe first surprise is its premise: This film is not about prison life. Oh, Shawshank is indeed the name of the prison and most of the film\\'s running time is spent within prison walls. But this is not solely about a warden, guards, prisoners, and the rough prison experience. These are only side notes in a much different symphony about friendship, loyalty, and, eventually, the redemption alluded to in the title.\\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\\'s\" friendship is between two very different people. Red (Morgan Freeman), the experienced lifer, is the film\\'s narrator. He makes his way through prison by procuring items from the outside and selling them to the inmates. Andy (Tim Robbins) is the \"fresh fish,\" as the inmates say, a new resident who is sized up from the moment he steps off the police truck.\\nThis is where the second surprise originates. We think the story is about Red, his take on prison life, his friendship with Andy, when in fact the reverse is true. This is Andy\\'s story. Red is only our eyes and our interpreter. He provides commentary and analysis but, similar to us, knows not until the end what is ticking under Andy\\'s cool exterior. Director Frank Darabont deserves a great deal of credit for remaining true to this approach. Even after the eventual redemption, we are still stranded alongside Red, wondering what has happened to Andy and when we might see him again.\\nSeeing this world from Red\\'s eyes, the audience is, rather daringly, put into unsure situations. Most movies use narration to help fill in the gaps. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" allows Red\\'s thoughts to widen them. In one moment, Red is convinced that Andy is plotting his own suicide. Red worries and frets and thinks of other possibilities. We too follow his line of thinking, being led astray by our faithful narrator. Andy\\'s true fate is more thrilling as a result.\\nOf course, with Andy\\'s fate, I am talking about the biggest surprise of the movie. Among the best endings of any film, the climax of \"The Shawshank Redemption\" actually builds through four separate segments. The first buildup occurs as Red frets about Andy. Red then recounts what really happened in the second climax. Then, Andy enacts revenge on those in the prison, providing a third, unexpected resolution. Red\\'s journey to the beach is the final bookend to a story so intense and complete in its conclusion that its final thirty minutes alone could be a movie on its own.\\nAppropriately, a film as unique as \"The Shawshank Redemption\" continues to surprise us long after the conventional climax has come and passed. As with all great movies, the final resolution is not found within its plot, but with its characters.\\nNone of this would matter without the formidable team mentioned earlier. Based on a short story by Steven King, this film uses the prison as more metaphor than realism. The guards could be any force opposing the prisoners. The prison itself is a tomb in which lives are wasted away. Andy\\'s destiny is strangely metaphoric. Standing in the rain, arms outstretched, he becomes less a person and more the culmination of his earlier talks with Red-the personification of hope that breaks free of the darkness.\\nTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give performances that defined their careers. Robbins keeps Andy hidden from the audience, somewhat aloof in his strange joy amidst Shawshank\\'s despair. Freeman imparts Red with such heart and such subtle intelligence that I find it difficult to admit that Red is not a real person. Freeman\\'s perfect moment comes after Andy\\'s disappearance. Red is in the field, working, and he notes the bittersweet joy he feels for Andy, sad that he is gone, but realizing it was wrong to ever lock him up in the first place. \"I just miss my friend,\" he concludes, and the straightforward honesty is overwhelming.\\nRoger Deakins\\' cinematography is often overlooked. In this film, he finds startling success in simplicity. The interior prison shots are dark and dreadful, but when important moments occur, my how the beauty comes out. Andy\\'s scream to the heavens is achingly perfect. Overhead shots of the prison are gorgeous. When Red goes to find the mysterious black box, another wonderful plot device, could the rural setting look any more like heaven?\\nEven Thomas Newman\\'s score is a triumph. Without guiding the audience to a predetermined conclusion, it accompanies moments with such elegance and such splendor that \"The Shawshank Redemption\" seems to exist free from the confines of the theater. Wisely, he allows the surprise to come first and his gorgeous work to accentuate the audience\\'s gasp.\\nThese surprising techniques succeed thanks to the filmmaker\\'s affection for the characters. Nothing is done at the expense of Red and Andy, their friendship, or their plight. They are at the forefront at all times. When Andy is thrown into solitary confinement, we witness both Andy\\'s endurance of his torture and Red\\'s worry for his friend. As Red and Andy discuss the past, the future, and the concept of hope, important plot points are occurring, but they blend seamlessly into a scene more about the characters in the present than the surprises to come.\\nThe memorable surprises in the film are only the icing on a carefully crafted cake. When Darabont spins the story upside down, it is only after we have invested our hearts and minds into these characters. Only later do we realize the plot has underlined the emotions all the while. We squeal with delight as they win. We feel compelled to rewind and watch it all again.\\nBut second visits, to our surprise, offer insights into more than just camera tricks or surprise endings. There is a plethora of nuances that crave discovery-minute expressions and missed dialogue often not caught in the first viewing.\\nAnd we keep watching also for Andy and Red. They have become like best friends to us, caught in the middle of hell. We watch again because their redemption warms our hearts. Their continuing ability to hope rubs off on us.\\n\\n\\nCheck out Reviews, Commentary, and More at Zertinet.com\\n  MOVIE WEB PAGE\\n\\nIMDB WEB PAGE\\nMOVIE REVIEW QUERY ENGINE\\nShowtimes\\nDAVID JOHNSON\\'S REVIEW\\n[ A group of prisoners, in a corrupt prison, meet a new prisoner who brings a touch of hope. If I saw that today I would immediately think \"crap.\" Of course today I would probably be right. We live in an age where movies are afraid to do the things that The Shawshank Redemption does right. Even the excellent movies of today find themselves hard pressed to create what this movie does. The Shawshank Redemption is a story about people. Not glorified mystical abstracts being played as people, but people. Today Shawshank would either be an action movie like \"The Rock\" or a think piece about the horrors of prison life and the necessary reforms necessary to bring about a better world. Neither of which I am particularly interested in.\\n\\nYet more than any movie I\\'ve seen in a while, my most recent viewing of Shawshank made me think more about the cruel nature of locking someone up and taking away their life (\"They lock you up for life and that\\'s exactly what they take.\") Through the characters in the movie you start to understand prison life on countless aspects. The need for control of the guards and the desire to find some little piece of freedom the prisoners have. Yet at the same time, the movie is not so one sided as to simply assume that each of these characters are innocent victims of the oppressive government. No, most of these people actually committed crimes. Most of them have killed before.\\n\\nMuch of the credit must be given to Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, actors that portray people that we can find ways to attach to. And people we can respect. Tim Robbins plays Andy an extremely private man who is placed in jail for killing his wife and her lover. Andy is an educated man, and lived life straight as an arrow on the outside. Morgan Freeman has been in jail for a while and is the local jails connection to goodies from the outside.\\n\\nShawshank does things well that you might not expect. It has lengthy voice-overs (that actually work well) and it has a sappy predictable ending, but yet these elements work because they are not placed in the over-used, meaningless context that movies today place them in. The voice overs are also consistently used in such a way that distinct worlds are created. There\\'s a real world inside the prison and the surreal outside world.\\n\\nThese two distinct worlds that are created help to place the viewer inside the halls of the prison. They are no longer watching a movie, but feeling it as well. What kind of world do we live in where this kind of movie can no longer exist.\\nMovies @ Zertinet | Oscars @ Zertinet | Main Site\\nIMDB | Moviefone | Movie Review Query Engine\\nContact Us | Subscribe | Unsubscribe\\nBest Viewed at 800 X 600 or greater\\nDesign by David Johnson\\n '},\n",

They remind us that hope is a precious and buoyant emotion which can give our lives substance and meaning.\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is based on a novella by Stephen King. Tim Robbins plays Andy, a banker who is sent to prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. The judge who sentences him finds him \"a particularly remorseless and icy man.\" Andy\\'s cool reserve and aloofness is not accepted well by the other inmates at Shawshank maximum-security prison in Maine. He is raped by some angry men and given several long stretches in solitary confinement for his bad attitude.\\nLuckily, Andy is befriended by Red, played by Morgan Freeman, the prison fixer. He is awed by this young man\\'s quiet reserve and inward resolve to make the best of his bad situation. Andy\\'s accounting skills come in handy, and he begins doing the taxes for the guards and laundering money for the corrupt warden. This lands him the cushy job of librarian. Eventually, Andy wrangles money out of state officials to build the best prison library anywhere.\\nWriter and director Frank Darabont draws out strong and intense performances from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins as soulmates who support each other while doing hard time. Red sees hope as a dangerous thing that can drive a man insane, but Andy believes it is fuel that keeps one going against all odds. The Shawshank Redemption is a jubilant tribute to hope as an essential quality of soul.\\nWarner Home Video, 09/94\\nFilm Feature\\nR - language, prison violence\\nPurchase from Amazon\\nRELATED\\nMAIN PRACTICE\\nHOPE\\nOTHER PRACTICES\\nBEAUTY\\nKEYWORDS\\nANGER\\nCONVERSATIONS\\nFRIENDSHIP\\nSOUL\\nVIOLENCE\\nTYPES OF CONTENT\\nPRACTICING DEMOCRACY PROJECT\\nRead our reflections on Beauty in The Shawshank Redemption\\nCONTACT US SUPPORT US STORE E-NEWSLETTER PRIVACY POLICY\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\nInstagram\\nPinterest\\nYouTube\\nRSS Feed\\nCopyright © 2006 - 2024 by CIStems, Inc., d.b.a.

       "   'Critic': \"The Shawshank Redemption\\n\\nby Stephen Farber\\n\\nThe Shawshank Redemption has been bewilderingly praised by some critics as a searing study of prison life. In truth it's the purest Hollywood hoakum--a sunny, heart-tugging hymn to that old chestnut, the indomitability of the human spirit. The acting is strong, and the tears are jerked effectively by director Frank Darabont. But this film is every bit as fraudulent as the year's other feel-good crock, Forrest Gump.\\n\\nWhat did you think of this movie? Sound off in the Movie Forum.\"},\n",

Shawshank — the name refers to a maximum-security prison in Maine — is already being touted to join Gump in the Oscar race. Why not? The academy regularly drops its drawers for films that celebrate the triumph of the human spirit. And this baby strums that theme hard as inmate Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a Shawshank newcomer in 1946, strikes up a 20-year friendship with a lifer named Red (Morgan Freeman). They’re both in jail for the Big One: murder.\\nRobbins and Freeman have the juice as actors to make figuring out whether Andy and Red really did it a riveting guessing game, especially if you’re a sucker for prison melodramas. Writer Frank Darabont (The Fly II), in his feature-directing debut, doesn’t skimp on the caged-bird cliches, sadistic and sentimental, but he plays enough hardball with the formula to evoke memories of such goodies as Cool Hand Luke, Birdman of Alcatraz and Riot in Cell Block II.\\nStephen King wrote the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, on which the film is based. (Andy’s cell is bedecked with a poster of Hayworth in all her Gilda glory.) You can find the novella in a 1982 King collection, Different Seasons, along with a story, “The Body,” that became the, basis for the 1986 Rob Reiner smash Stand by Me. Both tales are said to represent the gentler side of King, meaning the side that doesn’t sell as well, though the torture, rape and killing in Shawshank qualify as horror in my book.\\nDarabont stays mostly true to the source, except for shooting in Ohio instead of Maine, expanding a few scenes and characters and casting the always welcome Freeman as a prisoner King described as a red-headed Irishman. King is a master at creating a whole world out of small details. Darabont tries to match him visually. The everyday agonies of prison life are meticulously laid out by cinematographer Roger Deakins (Barton Fink). You can almost feel the frustration and rage seeping into the skin of the inmates.\\nTRENDING\\nTaylor Swift Celebrates Simone Biles, Sha’Carri Richardson, and Katie Ledecky in Moving Olympics Promo\\nMan Arrested at Morgan Wallen Concert After Making 'Terroristic Threat'\\nConservatives Accuse Olympic Boxer of Being a Man Because Her Opponent Quit\\nSee Adele Perform 'Chasing Pavements' For First Time in Seven Years as Munich Residency Begins\\nThere is humor, too, as Red brings the painfully introverted Andy out of his shell. Andy, a respected banker before being convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, wins favor and permission to expand the prison library by offering financial advice to the Shawshank elite. That includes Hadley (Clancy Brown), the cruel captain of the guards, and Norton (Bob Gunton), the fanatically religious warden. We’ve seen these types before. There are also cobwebs on Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), the aged parolee who can’t adjust to the outside, and Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows, in a role once earmarked for Brad Pitt), the young thief who can’t live inside.\\nIt’s the no-bull performances that hold back the flood of banalities. Robbins and Freeman connect with the bruised souls of Andy and Red to create something undeniably powerful and moving. Instead of selling bromides, as lesser actors would do, they show the wrenching struggle required by any human being in a trap simply to keep hope alive.\\nTV & MOVIES\\nTV & MOVIES REVIEWS\\nMORE NEWS\\nCan’t You Just Let Josh Hartnett Be an Indie Weirdo?\\nWELCOME BACK\\nBY BRITTANY SPANOS\\nHow Black Women in Hollywood Are Leading the Charge for Kamala Harris\\nPOETIC JUSTICE\\nBY KRYSTIE LEE YANDOLI\\nAlec Baldwin ‘Rust’ Judge Slams Prosecutors Over 'Deliberate Misconduct'\\nCOURTS AND CRIME\\nBY CHARISMA MADARANG\\n'War Game' Is the Scariest Documentary You'll See This Year\\nMOVIE REVIEW\\nBY DAVID FEAR\\nPunkie Johnson Confirms She's Leaving 'SNL': There's 'No Bad Blood'\\nPUNKIE'S OUT\\nBY TOMÁS MIER\\nREAD MORE\\nTHE LATEST\\nKanye West and Ty Dolla $ign Drop 'Vultures 2'\\n¥$ NO. 2\\nSee Adele Perform 'Chasing Pavements' For First Time in Seven Years as Munich Residency Begins\\n'IT ANNOYS ME'\\nKamala Harris' Campaign Blasts 'Scared' Trump for Proposing Fox News Debate\\n'RUNNING SCARED'\\nDrake and PartyNextDoor Announce Collaborative Album at Toronto Show\\nOVO SOUND\\nTHE DIGITAL DAILY NEWSLETTER\\nA Cultural Force That\\nTranscends Generations\\nEnter your Email\\nSUBSCRIBE\\nBY PROVIDING YOUR INFORMATION, YOU AGREE TO OUR TERMS OF USE AND OUR PRIVACY POLICY.

So it is that we draw our plans, visualise our dreams, and ignore the bitter voice that dwells in the darkest reaches of our subconscious. It’s a melancholy melody, and the song it sings reminds us that it could all come crashing down like the proverbial house of cards, in no more time than it takes to pull a trigger, fumble the keys into the ignition, or watch a State Trooper walk the distance from the front gate to your door.\\nStephen King knows the truth of it, and in 1982 he put it down on paper in a novella entitled Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. It was (and still is) one of his few mainstream efforts, bereft of supernatural occurrences and graphic murders. It’s a deceptively simple tale of friendship, injustice and the indomitable human spirit, and King plays with our fears of living out our lives within four high walls like a master puppeteer, leaving us no choice but to become entwined in the fate of his protagonists.\\n\\nIn 1987 a filmmaker by the name of Frank Darabont wrote to King and requested an option over the novella. King agreed, having been impressed by Darabont’s 1983 adaptation of his short story The Woman in the Room, and seven years later The Shawshank Redemption was released to an audience that, having been burned by countless B-grade King adaptations, was entitled to expect the worst.\\n\\nI know a great many people of varying tastes, and to this day there is exactly one film about which not one person has expressed a negative reaction, and with good reason. The Shawshank Redemption is a film about incarceration which transcends the genre, the combination of King’s imagination, Darabont’s flair for adaptation and a cadre of fine actors scything through the boundaries of age, class and philosophical inclination, leaving us with a near-perfect creation which proves that entertainment and depth don’t have to be mutually exclusive.\\n\\nThe film concerns itself with a twenty-year friendship between Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker sentenced to life for the murder of his wife and her lover, and Ellis “Red” Redding (Morgan Freeman), a con who has already been imprisoned for two decades when Dufresne arrives on the scene in 1947. The script charts Andy’s attempts to build a new life on the inside, his refusal to lose faith contrasting with Redding’s weary resignation, and works its way to a bittersweet finale which proves that even Pyrrhic victories can be a source of satisfaction.\\n\\nWith this film (and later with The Green Mile) Darabont proved himself a master of the art of adaptation. I have long held that undue interference with the source work is a crime punishable by death, but there are times when liberties must be taken to improve its translation to a visual medium. Darabont takes those liberties and then some, changing characters (Redding was a white Irishman in the novella), scenes (the ending is extended past King’s inconclusive finale) and dialogue (many of the best lines in the film are Darabont’s), and in so doing polishes one of the jewels in King’s crown until it shines. For this he is deserving of our highest praise, and every hack working the circuit today should look to him for inspiration, for with one monumental effort he proved that, provided you stay true to the spirit of the source, even the work of a master can be improved by the attentions of a talented screenwriter.\\n\\nIt would have all been for nothing, however, without the universally exceptional efforts of the cast. Whoever was responsible for recruiting the major players exhibited a great deal of faith, not the least in handing one of the lead roles to Robbins, who at the time had few high-profile performances to his name. Robbins is an unusual actor, for he seems at first glance to possess little screen presence or charisma, but he has a talent for getting under the viewer’s skin which makes him the man of choice for certain roles. With Shawshank he found his Everest, and the result is one of the most note-perfect performances you’re ever likely to see.\\n\\nDufresne is not an immediately likeable character – he can seem a little detached, a perception which is enhanced by Robbins’ trademark self-assurance. He is, however, an immediately identifiable character, for his initial foray into prison life effectively recreates the experience you or I would be likely to endure. I couldn’t beat off a trio of rapists or develop an instant rapport with my fellow convicts, and neither can Dufresne, so to anyone who has never wielded a lead-weighted pool cue in anger he assumes the guise of a kindred spirit. The result is a character who personifies our fear of being consigned to a ten-foot cell, alone with our fears and memories of happier times, left with nothing, as Red puts it, but “all the time in the world to think about it”. It is this identification which lies at the core of the film’s success, and it is Robbins’ moving, measured performance that makes it work.\\n\\nFor an actor who didn’t hit the big time until he was over 50, Morgan Freeman has stamped his authority on a surprisingly large number of films. Lean on Me, Glory, Driving Miss Daisy – none one of these would have been conceivable without his presence, and whenever the script calls for an elder statesman it’s a sure bet that he’s never far from the mind of the casting director. The sheer charisma of the man is all-but overpowering, an image heightened by Darabont’s decision to utilise voiceovers to advance the narrative. These exquisitely-crafted monologues represent, along with Goodfellas, possibly the most memorable use of the technique in recent memory, and Freeman’s grave, authoritative delivery is a wonder to behold. Barely ten minutes of screen time passes without comment, and it’s a testament to his (and Darabont’s) talents that it never becomes intrusive, but rather infuses the on-screen action with an even greater power than it would otherwise possess.\\n\\nSpecial mention must also go to Freeman’s ability to believably depict the effects of the passage of time. Red starts out as a reasonably-lively individual, but by the film’s conclusion is a man who has reached the tail-end of a long and trying life, and Freeman infuses him with a weariness which is almost tangible. Add to this his gloriously personable performance (especially in the first half) and a dedication to his character which defies any attempt to assert that he’s merely playing a role, and you’ve got an effort which, in a just world, would have seen him ascend the podium at the 1995 Academy Awards.\\n\\nElsewhere there’s much to like – the underused Bob Gunton is a delight as the corrupt warden, James Whitmore is almost painful to watch as the ancient Brooks (and that is intended as a compliment), and William Sadler (Heyward), Brian Libby (Floyd), Gil Bellows (Tommy) and Mark Rolston (Bogs) deserve statues in the bit-part hall of fame. However, the laurel wreath goes to Clancy Brown, who turns in an astonishing performance as Byron Hadley, a.k.a. the hardest screw ever to walk a turn at Shawshank State Prison. Brown’s chiselled features, stone-cold expression and bass-laden voice ensure Hadley takes his rightful place as one of the most menacing hard-asses ever to storm his way across the silver screen, and he gets to deliver some of the most memorable tsunamis of profanity this side of Full Metal Jacket into the bargain (in one of life’s little quirks, he reprised his role as a prison guard in The Hurricane, and proved that he\\'s equally capable of portraying compassion. Strange days indeed.)\\n\\nDespite the film’s extended running time (140 minutes), the script’s pacing ensures it rarely flags. There’s always something of interest going on, be it poignant, emotional exchanges between the characters, moments of hard-hitting (but never gratuitous) violence, or absorbing sequences backed by Red’s narration. The film also contains some of the most memorable movie moments you’re ever likely to witness - Andy’s rooftop showdown with Hadley, his impromptu operatic broadcast, Red’s final parole hearing, the entire fifteen-minute climax (which actually comes a good ten minutes before the end of the film) – rarely has a single film presented such an array of riches for our viewing pleasure, and subsequent viewings only enhance its impact.\\n\\nThe film is, on occasion, a somewhat-depressing exercise: it is infused with the weight of wasted years, reminding us that we are granted but one life, and that to live that life in vain is a cause for sorrow which defies consolation. There is a difference between living and simply existing, a difference many of the inmates eventually lose sight of, and it may just get you thinking about your life, and the fact that not all walls can be seen with the naked eye.\\n\\nIts dark undertones notwithstanding, the film is ultimately life-affirming, and not simply because of its soaring climax. Andy is a paragon of understated heroism, for he refuses to allow his sense of self-worth to join his freedom in the realms of distant memory. He may have lost everything he held dear, but he knows that life does not end until the day you draw your terminal breath, so he narrows his focus and takes refuge in his dreams of a better tomorrow. His existence reminds us of how much there is to lose, but also how much there is to gain, and is a source of solace for anyone who has ever felt their life begin to slip through their hands.\\n\\nThe script also makes an interesting point about human nature, in that the inmates are, by and large, reasonably likeable individuals. We never discover the exact nature of their crimes, for we are asked to judge them as they are, not for what they may have done. Good people sometimes do bad things, the film tells us, and all it takes is a single drunken argument which leaves a man dead to tarnish an entire life. Some may suggest that this approach denies the victims their due, but to dwell overlong on such an issue would have undermined the film’s central concerns. In any event, each of us is capable of deeds both admirable and reprehensible, and the script’s approach to its characters is a thought-provoking recognition of our inherent duality.\\n\\nAs director Darabont is reasonably unobtrusive, which is just as well since his restrained approach suits the film’s subject matter (it’s worth noting that the one scene in which he really lets loose, being an aerial shot of the prison towards the beginning of the film, is credited by Darabont to production designer Terence Marsh). Despite the absence of vibrant colours (it is set in a prison, after all) the film is still pleasing to the eye, largely due to the admirable lighting (both natural and artificial), and the memorable score is the perfect companion to the proceedings.\\n\\nAll of which goes some of the way towards justifying my belief that this is the greatest film ever committed to celluloid. I love this film, with a passion normally reserved for living, breathing entities, and the words it whispers resonate through the years, words which speak of friendship, regret and, most of all, hope. It tells us, in letters writ large, that our spirit will always be free, and when the closing credits roll I feel renewed, if only for the briefest of moments.\\n“Get busy living, or get busy dying”. That, my friends, is goddamn right.\\n(Awesome) Andrew Howe - 03/01/01 11:53:14\\n4 REVIEWS FOR THIS FILM:\\n      Select a reviewer from the list:\\nspork-girl (Awesome)\\nRyan Arthur (Awesome)\\nGodfather (Awesome)\\nlink directly to this review at http://efilmcritic.com/review.php?movie=1011&reviewer=193\\n printer-friendly format   email this reviewer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIF YOU\\'VE SEEN THIS FILM, RATE IT!\\nNote: Duplicate, \\'planted,\\' or other obviously improper comments\\nwill be deleted at our discretion.

Directed by Frank Darabont. Starring Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, James Whitmore.\\nREVIEWED BY MARC SAVLOV, FRI., SEPT. 23, 1994\\nTweet\\nprint\\nIn the wild, rolling hills of central Maine stands the Shawshank maximum security prison, a brooding stone obscenity rising out of the deeply forested acres that surround it. It is here, in 1947, that a young introverted banker by the name of Andy Dufresne (Robbins) finds himself incarcerated after being convicted of the brutal murders of his wife and her golf-pro lover. In a place where the running joke is “everyone is innocent,” Andy Dufresne may be the only one who really is, thanks to his being in the wrong place at the wrong time. It\\'s here that he meets Red (Freeman), a grizzled lifer with little hope of parole, and the man who “knows how to get things”: cigarettes, booze, girlie mags, whatnot. Overseen by the dictatorial Warden Norton (Gunton), a bible-thumping hypocrite with a taste for easy money, and his right hand thug Captain Hadley (Brown), the prison is a nightmare factory of midnight beatings, corrupt politics, and desperate hopelessness, where bull queers target the weak “new fish” -- like Andy -- and take what they want by force while the guards look away. Over the course of his life sentence, Andy and Red become close friends, helping each other out in various ways while coping with the deadeningly monotonous routine of prison life. Warden Norton eventually finds a use for Andy as well: Seeing as how Dufresne was a banker on the outside, the warden puts his talents to use on the inside, having him file tax returns and give financial advice to the guards and, over the course of the passing years, setting up a massive and intricate money-laundering machine that will eventually make millionaires of the warden and his cronies. Darabont\\'s feature film debut is not only the best film yet adapted from a story by Stephen King, but also one of the best films to come out this year. Ostensibly a big-house story, the film deals more with the topics of personal dignity, friendship, and hope than anything else. Freeman and Robbins are literally perfect here and the supporting cast, from Sadler as the stammering inmate Heywood, to Gunton\\'s Warden Norton are casting miracles. Darabont (who previously directed a short film based on King\\'s “The Woman in the Room”) wisely sticks closely to King\\'s riveting tale, sometimes lifting whole passages of dialogue from the novella, and keeps the story moving along at steady pace throughout its lengthy 142-minute running time. Along with production designer Terence Marsh (Lawrence of Arabia, Oliver), Darabont makes Shawshank into the archetypal hell few prison dramas can muster. It\\'s the story, though, adapted by Darabont himself, that carries the film along. At times poignant, joyful, and terrifying, The Shawshank Redemption is an altogether brilliant movie and the debut of an equally brilliant director.\\nA note to readers: Bold and uncensored, The Austin Chronicle has been Austin’s independent news source for over 40 years, expressing the community’s political and environmental concerns and supporting its active cultural scene.

       "   'Critic': 'Peter James Monica Keena Gary Mckendry Monica Keena\\nHome\\nVideo Views\\nReelThoughts\\nCurrently in Cinema\\nReelViews Library\\nBECOME A PATREON\\nLogin\\nShawshank Redemption, The (United States, 1994)\\nA movie review by James Berardinelli\\nWith a legion of titles like Pet Sematary, Firewalker, Sleepwalkers, Maximum Overdrive, and Children of the Corn, it\\'s reasonable not to expect much from Stephen King-inspired motion pictures. Adaptations of the prolific author\\'s work typically vary from mildly entertaining to virtually unwatchable. There are a few notable exceptions, however; two of which (Stand by Me, Misery) were crafted by widely-respected director Rob Reiner. While The Shawshank Redemption is not a Reiner movie per se, it is a production of Castle Rock Pictures (Reiner\\'s film company), and ranks among the best filmed versions of any King stories to date. (This statement has not changed since I first wrote it in 1994.)\\nSpanning the years from 1947 through 1966, The Shawshank Redemption takes the \"innocent man in prison\" theme and bends it at a different angle. Instead of focusing on crusades for freedom, the movie ventures down a less-traveled road, concentrating on the personal cost of adapting to prison life and how some convicts, once they conform, lose the ability to survive beyond the barbed wire and iron bars. As one of the characters puts it: \"These [prison] walls are funny. First you hate them, then you get used to them, then you start to depend on them.\"\\nFilmed on location in a disused Ohio prison, The Shawshank Redemption is set in a place of perpetual dreariness. What little color there is, is drab and lifeless (lots of grays and muted greens and blues), and there are times when the film is a shade away from black-and-white (give credit to cinematographer Roger Deakins, a longtime Cohen brothers collaborator). It\\'s ironic, therefore, that the central messages are of hope, redemption, and salvation.\\nFirst time feature director Frank Darabont helms a fleet of impressive performances. Tim Robbins, as Andrew Dufresne, plays the wrongly convicted man with quiet dignity. Andy\\'s ire is internal; he doesn\\'t rant about his situation or the corruptness of the system that has imprisoned him. His unwillingness to surrender hope wins him the admiration of some and the contempt of others, and allows the audience to identify with him that much more strongly.\\nEllis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman), or \"Red\" as his friends call him, is the self-proclaimed \"Sears and Roebuck\" of the Shawshank Prison (for a price, he can get just about anything from the outside). His is the narrative voice and, for once, the disembodied words aid, rather than intrude upon, the story. Serving a life sentence for murder, Red is a mixture of cynicism and sincerity - a man with a good soul who has done a vile deed. His friendship with Andy is one of The Shawshank Redemption\\'s highlights.\\nWilliam Sadler (as a fellow prisoner), Clancy Brown (as a sadistic guard), and Bob Gunton (as the corrupt warden) all give fine supporting performances. Newcomer Gil Bellows, in a small but crucial role (that was originally intended for Brad Pitt), brings the poise of a veteran to his portrayal of Tommy Williams, Andy\\'s protege.\\nUltimately, the standout actor is the venerable James Whitmore, doing his finest work in years. Whitmore\\'s Brooks is a brilliantly realized character, and the scenes with him attempting to cope with life outside of Shawshank represents one of the film\\'s most moving - and effective - sequences.\\nUnfortunately, following a solid two hours of thought-provoking drama, the movie deflates like a punctured balloon during its overlong denouement. The too-predictable final twenty minutes move a little slowly, and writer/director Darabont exposes a distressing need to wrap up everything into a tidy little package.\\n\"Salvation lies within,\" advises Warden Norton at one point. It is the presentation of this theme that makes The Shawshank Redemption unique. Prison movies often focus on the violence and hopelessness of a life behind bars. While this film includes those elements, it makes them peripheral. The Shawshank Redemption is all about hope and, because of that, watching it is both uplifting and cathartic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShawshank Redemption, The (United States, 1994)\\nDirector: Frank Darabont\\nCast: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows\\nScreenplay: Frank Darabont based on \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\" by Stephen King\\nCinematography: Roger Deakins\\nMusic: Thomas Newman\\nU.S. Distributor: Columbia Pictures\\nRun Time: 2:22\\nU.S. Release Date: 1994-09-03\\nMPAA Rating: \"R\" (Profanity, Violence, Mature Themes)\\nGenre: DRAMA\\nSubtitles: none\\nTheatrical Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1\\nComments\\nAdd Comment\\nThree...\\nbetter movies of this genre\\nCider House Rules, The (1999)\\nCitizen Kane (1941)\\nWar Zone, The (1999)\\nworse movies of this genre\\nHole in My Heart, A (2005)\\nNeon Demon, The (2016)\\nShowgirls (1995)\\nThree...\\nbetter movies of Tim Robbins\\nMystic River (2003)\\nShort Cuts (1993)\\nHudsucker Proxy, The (1994)\\nworse movies of Tim Robbins\\nMission to Mars (2000)\\nHoward the Duck (1986)\\nCode 46 (2004)\\nThree...\\nbetter movies of Morgan Freeman\\nGlory (1989)\\nDark Knight, The (2008)\\nGone Baby Gone (2007)\\nworse movies of Morgan Freeman\\nBruce Almighty (2003)\\nHard Rain (1998)\\nHitman\\'s Wife\\'s Bodyguard (2021)\\nThree...\\nbetter movies of Bob Gunton\\nLincoln Lawyer, The (2011)\\nBroken Arrow (1996)\\n(There are no more better movies of Bob Gunton)\\nworse movies of Bob Gunton\\nPatch Adams (1998)\\n33, The (2015)\\n(There are no more worst movies of Bob Gunton)\\nReelViews\\nLibrary\\nCurrently in Cinema\\nWritings\\nFictional Writings\\nReelThoughts\\nSpecials\\nAbout\\nPrivacy Policy\\nTerms and Conditions\\nContact\\nWebsite credits'},\n",

       "   'Critic': '\\'The Shawshank Redemption\\' (R)\\nBy Rita Kempley\\nWashington Post Staff Writer\\nSeptember 23, 1994\\nThough adapted from a Stephen King novella, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" has more to do with a man\\'s internal demons than the kind that routinely rise up from overgrown graveyards. Like \"Stand by Me,\" it\\'s not a typical story from the horror King. Instead, it\\'s a devoutly old-fashioned, spiritually uplifting prison drama about two lifers who must break their emotional shackles before they can finally become free men.\\nSet in a spooky old penitentiary with turrets and towers, the movie manages to be true to its Big House origins while incorporating such horrific mainstays as the clanking of chains and the creaking of the walls. There\\'s even a raven that roosts in the prison library, where he is cared for by a darling old trusty (James Whitmore). For the most part, however, the movie expands upon cliches that date back to James Cagney\\'s prison portraits—the twisted warden (Bob Gunton) and the sadistic guard (Clancy Brown).\\nDirector Frank Darabont, who apprenticed on B-scripts (\"The Fly II\") and TV movies (\"Buried Alive\"), manages to fashion an improbable new pattern from the same old material in his remarkable debut. While he deals with the grimmest aspects of prison life (sadistic guards, gang rapes and befouled food), Darabont is chiefly interested in the 20-year friendship that sustains Andy (Tim Robbins) and Red (Morgan Freeman) .\\nThe movie opens in 1947 as Andy, a prominent New England banker, is on trial for murdering his wife and her lover. Not only did he have a motive, but he had the opportunity—his footprints were found at the scene of the crime—and he had a weapon of the caliber used in the shootings. He insists that he is innocent, but the jury finds him guilty. Sentenced to life twice over, Andy is shipped to the maximum-security state prison at Shawshank, Maine. An introverted loner with an interest in reading, chess and rock carving, Andy doesn\\'t make himself many friends until Red, a 30-year-veteran of the system, decides to take him under his wing.\\nThings begin to change for the better when Andy finds a way to use his skills and education to benefit his fellow felons. When he overhears the guard captain complaining about losing most of an inheritance to taxes, he offers to trade his advice for three beers for each of the men who are working with him that day tarring the roof.\\nHis reputation as a financial adviser spreads, and soon he is doing the taxes for all the guards and running the warden\\'s outside scams. This leads to a position in the tiny prison library, which Andy gradually expands into the best educational facility of its kind in the area. It takes him six years to do it, but Andy never gives up hope.\\nIt is hope that allows the self-proclaimed innocent man to survive what may or may not be an unjust imprisonment. And hope is his gift to his friend Red, who no longer even tries to impress the parole board at his hearings. He\\'s become \"institutionalized,\" he explains to Andy, and would be a \"nobody\" on the outside.\\nRed\\'s gift to Andy is absolution when he finally confesses his true sins. Whether or not he pulled the trigger, Andy blames himself for causing his wife\\'s death; his redemption comes as he learns to give of himself over the course of this marvelously acted and directed film.\\nRobbins gives a performance that evolves with beautiful clarity from starchy banker to warm and loving friend. Freeman is sure to gain his third Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Red. He also reads the film\\'s lovely narration, much of it drawn verbatim from King\\'s 1982 novella.\\nA detailed portrait of the routine of cellblock life, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" might change a few minds about the usefulness of incarceration in terms of rehabilitation. Mostly, though, it reminds us of that we all hold the keys to our own prisons.\\nCopyright The Washington Post\\nBack to the top'},\n",

And like the former film, the latter is one of the best to be adapted from a King story. (It also marks the second Tim Robbins movie of the year with an odd title — anyone remember \"The Hudsucker Proxy\"?)\\n\"Shawshank\" is what might be described as an ethereal prison picture, if that\\'s not an oxymoron.\\nRobbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a New England banker who is given a life sentence (two, actually) for the murder of his wife and her lover in 1947. Did he do it? He claims to be innocent. But then, so do all the other inmates in the fictional maximum-security Shawshank State Prison in Maine.\\nThe film begins like most movies in this genre, chronicling Andy\\'s crime, his sentencing, his imprisonment and then showing his adjustment to prison life as an innocent among wolves.\\nBut then, the film takes some unexpected twists and turns. Andy isn\\'t like any other prisoner. He\\'s quiet and reflective, he\\'s a reader and chess player, and he keeps to himself. In fact, he doesn\\'t make any acquaintances until he approaches a 30-year veteran and well-known prison procurer (Morgan Freeman, who also gives the film its voice-over narration) for assistance in his rock-carving hobby.\\nThe friendship that develops between Andy and Red is the center of the film, and both actors are in top form — which is considerable. They are the main reason to see the movie (along with a wonderful supporting bit by James Whitmore). But the filmmakers give the prison cliches — and they\\'re all here — some nods and winks and tweaks that are quite unexpected.\\nAfter a time, Andy is able to use his accounting skills as a means of getting special privileges — but he doesn\\'t just get them for himself. He seems to be a selfless fellow, parlaying his efforts into developing a useful prison library and making life a bit more tolerable for some of his comrades.\\nView Comments\\nUltimately, however, we discover that Andy is even more than he seems. And his achievements go off in fascinating directions (though the final shot may seem a bit overly contrived).\\nPrison pictures are an overly familiar genre. But at their best — \"Cool Hand Luke,\" \"The Birdman of Alcatraz,\" etc. — they are remarkable character studies. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" manages to climb into this rank by keeping the story off-center and the twists highly entertaining in unexpected ways.\\nMy main complaint is the film\\'s length. At 21/2 hours, it tends to sag a bit and could certainly use some tightening. But it\\'s a small complaint for a movie this satisfying.\\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is rated R for the expected prison violence (though the worst of it is off camera) and language. There is also a brief sex scene and some nudity.\\nUtah Today\\nGet all the news that\\'s happening in the Beehive State in one place, as well as major national and world news that you value.\\nSUBSCRIBE\\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Notice and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\\nBrowse All Newsletters\\nReport ad\\nYou Might Also Like\\nRecommended by\\nIslamabad: You Might Be Surprised By The Price Of Sofas In Mexico\\nSponsor: Sofas In Mexico | Search Ads\\nUnsold 2022 Smartphones Could Be Given Away For Almost Nothing\\nSponsor: Best Smartphone Deals | Search Ads\\nHere\\'s what the University of Utah president learned from the athlete housing at the Paris Olympics\\nDeseret News\\nBallerina Farm: Who is Hannah Neeleman, the influencer behind the ‘Trad Wife’ controversy?\\nDeseret News\\nBYU is officially a finalist for the nation’s No. 1 recruit, AJ Dybantsa\\nDeseret News\\nWork From Home Jobs in Islamabad May Pay More Than You Think\\nSponsor: Search Ads\\nDiscover the Best Cat Footwear with Yahoo\\nSponsor: Yahoo!

       "   'Critic': 'MOVIE REVIEWS\\nTV/STREAMING\\nCOLLECTIONS\\nCHAZ\\'S JOURNAL\\nGREAT MOVIES\\nINTERVIEWS\\nCONTRIBUTORS\\nReviews\\nThe Shawshank Redemption\\nRoger Ebert September 23, 1994\\nTweet\\nRed (Morgan Freeman, left) and Andy (Tim Robbins) are prisoners who form a friendship in \"The Shawshank Redemption.\"\\nNOW STREAMING ON:\\nPowered by JustWatch\\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.\\nThe story is narrated by \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nBut Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he\\'s in for murder. He\\'s apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.\\nRed is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nRed\\'s narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he\\'s been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden\\'s office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden\\'s ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he\\'s doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.\\nThere are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nThe partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a \"prison drama\" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word \"redemption\" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King\\'s work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man\\'s life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nThe director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.\\nAndy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.\\nDRAMA\\nCRIME\\nRoger Ebert\\nRoger Ebert was the film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times from 1967 until his death in 2013.
