So its no surprise that the latest Tim Robbins movie, The Shawshank Redemption, based on a King novella, sometimes strains credulity. Soft-spoken New England banker Andy Dufresne (played by Robbins) is convicted of a crime he didnt commit the murder of his wife and her lover. Not that he didnt want to kill them. Parked outside the couples tryst, he fuels himself with a flask, loads his revolver and gets out of the car to wreak a cuckolds revenge ...\\nbut he just doesnt have it in him. It looks more like a lack of gumption than a triumph of conscience especially when he offers a mealymouthed defense at the trial. So oncehes imprisoned for the double murder, the resilience, resoluteness and resourcefulness he shows behind the walls of Shawshank State Prison arise from a well of strength that he seemingly didnt have. The movie, directed by Frank Darabont, offers the notion that many inmates at a maximum-security penitentiary are just misunderstood ex-Rotarians. However, if you can get past patchy character development and lefty underpinnings about criminal justice, The Shawshank Redemption stands as an uplifting story of enduring hope forged by an indomitable spirit and the bonds of a rock-solid friendship.\\nWhen Andy and several newcomers first arrive in 1947, the veteran inmates take bets on which one will crack first. Red, the prisons fixer (Morgan Freeman) who can get just about any contraband inside, wagers on the milquetoast mo-neyman. Andy copes; Red loses. Initially aloof, Andy eventually asks Red to sneak in a rock hammer, explaining that he simply wants to indulge his interest in geology and carve a chess set. I As their friendship develops, Red teaches Andy about survival on the inside while Andy teaches Red about never giving up the idea of a good life on the outside.\\nSo when Andy asks for Rita Hayworth to be snuck in, Red comes through albeit with just a sexy poster. As 19 years pass, Rita is supplanted by Marilyn Monroe in the 50s and Raquel Welch (in her skimpiest One Million Years B.C. best) in the 60s. And as the film unfolds, a rock hammer in tandem with a good two-dimensional woman proves to be quite the combo. Andy, meanwhile, thrives in a financial-planning cottage industry that provides one of the movies surprises.\\nDarabont, who previously directed a USA Network cable movie and a PBS short film, adapted Kings story for the screen. He allows the story to drag occasionally, but he captures the oppressive atmosphere of a hard-time jail and makes a sure-handed debut as a director for the big screen. Robbins, whose stardom again is reinforced with' this performance, gives a neatly understated rendering of Andy. r Two-time Academy Award nominee James Whitmore makes a welcome return to movies after seven years, playing the prisons librarian, Brooks. Freeman, whose Red learns how to avoid Brooks fate, stands tallest among this strong ensemble.\\nActor Tim Robbins, right, and Redemption.

In this final installment, we unveil the top 25 films that have left an enduring legacy on the world of cinema. From immortal film criterion to esteemed contemporary crafts, these cinematic gems have captivated audiences for generations. Let’s dive right into the grand finale of our 95-year odyssey and celebrate the artistry, storytelling, and enduring impact of these extraordinary films. and Part Three (50-26) here.\\nYou can find Part One (95-76) here; Part Two (75-51) here; and Part Three (50-26) here.\\n25. The French Connection (1971)\\nSummary: In William Friedkin’s The French Connection, Gene Hackman stars as Jimmy ‘Popeye’ Doyle, a bigoted and eccentric police officer consumed by his job. Alongside his partner Cloudy (Roy Scheider), he’s on the trail to bust a shipment of heroin on its way from France to New York. Embedded in the style and themes of classic film noir, The French Connection is a grim and relentless detective thriller that is celebrated as one of the most authentic films about police work (celebrated by all who would not censor it, that is). It also happens to feature the greatest car chase scene in film history.\\nWhat it beat: A Clockwork Orange, Fiddler on the Roof, The Last Picture Show, Nicholas and Alexandra\\nHindsight’s a bitch: There isn’t a film on this portion of the list that I disagree with. All 25 of these films find a place in my own Top 100 films of all-time, so I make no arguments against any of them winning. My personal preference from 1971: Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange. This is the fifth time I have argued for a Kubrick film as the best of its year. This doesn’t surprise me, as Kubrick is the director that I would cite as the greatest ever. What does surprise me is that none of his five masterpieces ever won Best Picture.\\n24. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)\\nSummary: Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings is one of the most astonishing achievements in the history of film. Creating a franchise that both revolutionized visual effects (Gollum) and was emotionally gripping enough to contain four finales is what led to The Return of the King tying the Oscar record of 11 wins.\\nWhat it beat: Lost in Translation, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, Mystic River, Sea Biscuit\\nHindsight’s a bitch: The Academy got it correct. The third installment in Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy probably won for the collective set of films, not just on its own merit. Because of this assumption – and due to all three films being shot at one time – I view the trilogy as one title when placing it on lists. Jackson’s massive accomplishment is nothing short of magical.\\n23. All Quiet on the Western Front (1929/1930)\\nSummary: No film detailed the horrors of World War I better than Lewis Milestone’s All Quiet on the Western Front. A technically groundbreaking film that doubles as an extremely powerful anti-war message, All Quiet is the oldest film on my own top 100 list. The 2022 remake was my number one film of the year, showing how outstanding Erich Maria Remarque’s classic novel was in its time and to this day.\\nWhat it beat: The Big House, Disraeli, The Divorcee, The Love Parade\\nHindsight’s a bitch: The Academy got it correct.\\n22. Rocky (1976)\\nSummary: The ultimate tale of the underdog might also be one of the great longshot films to ever win Best Picture, and there may never be a more stirring and energetic film to win the coveted prize. Full of montages and crowd-pleasing moments that have become clichés in sports films, Rocky is an incredible tale of a down-and-out boxer who gets a shot at the heavyweight title. Rocky beautifully encapsulates the essence of the blue-collar worker, drawing a striking parallel to Sylvester Stallone’s own journey before this monumental breakthrough. Stallone wrote, starred in, and handled the boxing choreography for one of the most benevolent films ever made. Want proof? I bet you thought about that Rocky theme as soon as you saw the image above. That’s just an example of the enduring legacy of the film.\\nWhat it beat: All the President’s Men, Bound for Glory, Network, Taxi Driver\\nHindsight’s a bitch: When discussing the finest years in film history, 1976 undoubtedly emerges as a strong contender for the top of that list. I could argue for several of these nominees to win, but Martin Scorsese’s timeless Taxi Driver remains my favorite of the group.\\n21. Midnight Cowboy (1969)\\nSummary: Midnight Cowboy was the perfect film to bring in the counter-culture vibe of the ’70s, and the mutable MPAA implementation that was still in flux makes for its often referenced stat as the only X-rated film to win Best Picture. Gritty, grimy, and groundbreaking for its time, John Schlesinger’s buddy film about two desolate and penniless characters – one a greasy con artist (Dustin Hoffman), the other a naïve gigolo (Jon Voight) – form a bizarre friendship. Paired with another film that year, Dennis Hopper’s Easy Rider, Midnight Cowboy brought an end to the “Cultural Decade” and helped usher in the New Hollywood era of the “Me Decade.”\\nWhat it beat: Anne of a Thousand Days, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Hello Dolly!, Z\\nHindsight’s a bitch: The Academy got it correct. Few films have been more avant-garde in approach, nor more perpetually relevant than Midnight Cowboy.\\n20. The Sound of Music (1965)\\nSummary: In The Sound of Music, Julie Andrews is Maria, an Austrian nun who takes on an assignment as the governess to the seven Von Trapp children. She tends to their needs, romances their father, and teaches the children to sing. And if you don’t sing along to every word of the gorgeous Rodgers & Hammerstein soundtrack, what fan of movies are you really? One of the highest grossing blockbusters of all-time, Robert Wise’s The Sound of Music is a film that has resonated with audiences spanning several generations.\\nWhat it beat: Darling, Doctor Zhivago, Ship of Fools, A Thousand Clowns\\nHindsight’s a bitch: The Sound of Music is one of those films I must have watched over a hundred times as a child. You know, way back when we only had like four channels and a closet full of VCR tapes (google it, youngins). The Academy got it correct.\\n19. Ben-Hur (1959)\\nSummary: The first film to set the record for winning 11 Oscars, William Wyler’s epic tale of Christ, Ben-Hur, remains one of the greatest stories ever told. From the antagonizing, Odysseyesque journey of the main protagonist (Oscar-winning performance by Charlton Heston), to the incredible cast of thousands, elaborate set designs, and one of the greatest sequences in film history (the spectacular chariot race), Ben-Hur is one of the most influential films on this list (just look at the list of epics that followed in its wake).\\nWhat it beat: Anatomy of a Murder, The Diary of Anne Frank, The Nun’s Story, Room at the Top\\nHindsight’s a bitch: This is another film that shaped my youth. Being my father’s favorite movie ever made, I have seen Ben-Hur so many times I can quote just about every line. The fact that I never get tired of watching it (despite a 212-minute runtime) is proof enough that Ben-Hur is one of the greatest movies ever made. The Academy got it correct.\\n18. The Deer Hunter (1978)\\nSummary: Michael Cimino’s tale about the physical, emotional, and psychological impacts the Vietnam War had on a group of friends remains one of the ultimate masterpieces in film history. The Deer Hunter stars Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken, John Savage, and John Cazale – who all give performances that are among the finest of their career. It’s a controversial film in the way it depicts the Viet Cong (the Russian roulette scenes, in particular), but in war, there are rarely good guys. The intense and dramatic turns that happen over the course of the film are as gut-wrenching and enthralling as anything I have ever seen. Very few films have ever captured the unsparing aftermath of war quite as devastatingly.\\nWhat it beat: Coming Home, Heaven Can Wait, Midnight Express, An Unmarried Woman\\nHindsight’s a bitch: From the blue-collared, Pennsylvania town to the cruel and decimating jungles of Southeast Asia, The Deer Hunter is a perfectly compelling film. The Academy got it correct.\\n17. Annie Hall (1977)\\nSummary: One of the most brilliant and inventive comedies, Woody Allen’s Annie Hall is his most grounded and accomplished work. Bittersweet and hysterical, Allen plays the neurotic Alvy Singer, a divorcee reflecting on his past relationships, most notably the love of his life, Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). One of the quintessential romantic comedies to ever win Best Picture.\\nWhat it beat: The Goodbye Girl, Julia, Star Wars, The Turning Point\\nHindsight’s a bitch: As much as I love Annie Hall, there was a little film called Star Wars that same year. Take nothing away from Annie Hall, a bona fide masterpiece, but Star Wars has a legacy that is unmatched in the cinematic universe.\\n16. Amadeus (1984)\\nSummary: Winner of eight Academy Awards, Miloš Forman’s Amadeus is a fascinating study of the real-life rivalry of 18th-century composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) and Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham). Lavish and flamboyant in every manner, Amadeus is the rare period piece costume drama that made me fall in love with it. F. Murray Abraham’s vile and sinister performance as the envious Salieri, a man with more desire to produce music than God gave him talent to create, is one for the ages.\\nWhat it beat: The Killing Fields, A Passage to India, Places in the Heart, A Soldier’s Story\\nHindsight’s a bitch: Never has there been a more extravagant tale of jealousy and contempt than what is formed between two artists in Amadeus. The Academy got it correct.\\n15. No Country for Old Men (2007)\\nSummary: In the aftermath of a botched drug deal, a weathered Sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) contemplates the nature of violence as he races against time to locate a missing man (Josh Brolin) before the sinister figure of Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) hunts him down. Based on the neo-western Cormac McCarthy novel, No Country for Old Men is the Coen Brothers’ masterpiece. Filled with violence, suspense, and the dark comedy that has made the Coens famous, No Country remains a deeply profound look at how time passes us all by, and no matter how hard we try, we can’t stop what’s coming.\\nWhat it beat: Atonement, Juno, Michael Clayton, There Will Be Blood\\nHindsight’s a bitch: The Coens’ best film remains the greatest film of the 21st century. No Country works as an ode to West Texas, thanks in large part to the devastatingly gorgeous landscapes shot by the incomparable Roger Deakins. As much as I also love There Will Be Blood, the Academy got it correct.\\n14.  The Apartment (1960)\\nSummary: Billy Wilder’s The Apartment works as both poignant tragedy and romantic comedy. Hoping to climb the corporate ladder, Jack Lemmon plays CC Baxter, an office shill who loans out his apartment to his bosses so they can carry out their affairs without getting caught. Things become complicated when one of the bosses (Fred MacMurray) wants to use the apartment to take Baxter’s workplace crush, Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), there for the evening.\\nWhat it beat: The Alamo, Elmer Gantry, Sons and Lovers, The Sundowners\\nHindsight’s a bitch: The Apartment is smart as a whip, as enchanting as it is thought-provoking. A terrific examination of the desperation to get ahead in corporate America as well as a study in melancholy, Billy Wilder and his legendary co-writer, I.A.L. Diamond, prove once again why they are the greatest screenwriting duo of all-time. As much as I love The Apartment (as seen by its high placing on this list), Alfred Hitchcock’s immortal and hair-raising thriller, Psycho (which wasn’t even nominated), was the best film of 1960.\\n13. West Side Story (1961)\\nSummary: Jerome Robbins and William Wise’s West Side Story, a musical re-interpretation of William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, takes place on the streets of 1950s New York City. Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer star as the modern-day versions of Shakespeare’s star-crossed lovers. Societal class and teenage angst are central themes as a group of white kids match wits – and cutting-edge dance choreography – with a group of Puerto Rican youth, fighting for supremacy over the neighborhood they share. Loaded with innumerable and distinguished songs by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim (each one an earworm of its own), West Side Story is a tale of race and social decorum and is an incredibly inventive adaptation of the legendary love story.\\nWhat it beat: Fanny, The Guns of Navarone, The Hustler, Judgement at Nuremberg\\nHindsight’s a bitch: One of the two or three greatest musicals of all-time (and the best to ever win Best Picture), the Academy got it correct.\\n12. The Best Years of Our Lives (1946)\\nSummary: Fredric March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell star as a trio of veterans returning home from war in William Wyler’s The Best Years of Our Lives. Perhaps no film has detailed the struggles of our heroes returning home from battle as well as Best Years. Post-traumatic stress disorders and difficulties with reintegrating into society are just a couple of challenges these men face. Its groundbreakingly authentic views of veterans was bolstered by Harold Russell’s Oscar-winning performance. Russell, an actual veteran who lost his hands in the war, is playing himself, and as such provides a visceral and tender-hearted core to the film.\\nWhat it beat: Henry V, It’s a Wonderful Life, The Razor’s Edge, The Yearling\\nHindsight’s a bitch: The Best Years of Our Lives makes for an incredible companion piece to Michel Cimino’s The Deer Hunter (see #18 on this list). Both films portray the impacts of war in unique and paramount ways. Like The Apartment, it’s hard to say that a film ranked this high wasn’t the one I would have voted for. The sentimentalist in me can’t help but slightly prefer It’s a Wonderful Life for all its mushy heart and tenderness.\\n11. One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975)\\nSummary: Rather than spending his time crushing rocks and doing hard time in prison, habitual criminal Randall P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) decides to take “the easy way out” by committing himself to a mental institution. Little did he know he’d run into the caretaker from his worst nightmares, Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). Adapted from Ken Kesey’s novel of the same name, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest is an electrifying observation of the need for reform in our mental institutions. Along with It Happened One Night and The Silence of the Lambs, Cuckoo’s Nest is one of three films to win the Big Five at Oscar: Picture, Director (Miloš Forman), Actor (Nicholson), Actress (Fletcher), and Screenplay.\\nWhat it beat: Barry Lyndon, Dog Day Afternoon, Jaws, Nashville\\nHindsight’s a bitch: Oh boy. Now we are reaching into movies that would be in my top 15 or so films of all time. As much as I love Jaws, the Academy got it correct. There are few characters I connect with more than Nicholson’s McMurphy (what the hell does that say about me?), making Cuckoo’s Nest a tough one to leave outside my top ten. In one scene, McMurphy comes to realize that most of the crackpots around him are all at the asylum voluntarily. The shock of this discovery quickly transitions into a disquieting realization that as kooky as all these men around him are, McMurphy is the one who is required to be there. That’s a feeling I have been all too familiar with throughout my life, and the way Nicholson pulls it off makes for one of the greatest performances in all of film.\\n10. The Silence of the Lambs (1991)\\nSummary: The Silence of the Lambs is the only horror film to ever win Best Picture. It is also one of the three films I mentioned above that won the Big Five. Jonathan Demme’s eerie film stars Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, a young FBI recruit who wrestles wits and power dynamics with the famed genius and convict Hannibal “The Cannibal” Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to help track down another serial killer. Suspenseful and shrewd, Hopkins’ Lecter is one of the most fascinating villains in film (despite less than 20 minutes of screentime). In spite of his contemptible reproach and steely demeanor, there’s just something about Lecter that makes us root for him.\\nWhat it beat: Beauty and the Beast, Bugsy, JFK, The Prince of Tides\\nHindsight’s a bitch: Fava beans and chianti will never be regarded without a lizard-tongued shiver. The Academy got it correct.\\n9. Schindler’s List (1993)\\nSummary: Known primarily for his huge blockbusters, Steven Spielberg’s masterpiece is his contemplative adaptation of Ken Keneally’s solemn chronicle of the Holocaust, Schindler’s List. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), like most German manufacturers at the time, was a member of the Nazi party. But unlike the average entrepreneur, Schindler was a complex individual who went from capitalizing on the times by operating war factories for the Nazis, only to end up saving more than 1,000 Polish Jews from certain death. Spielberg’s most personal film is also his finest and most altruistic.\\nWhat it beat: The Fugitive, In the Name of the Father, The Piano, The Remains of the Day\\nHindsight’s a bitch: Crazy to think that in the same year that Spielberg made Schindler’s List, he also delivered the enormous hit, Jurassic Park. The Academy got it correct.\\n8. On the Waterfront (1954)\\nSummary: Known for the powerful portrayal of anguish that permanently changed acting, Marlon Brando is Terry Malloy, a former heavyweight contender who has been reduced to a struggling longshoreman in Elia Kazan’s On the Waterfront. Corruption employs the docks where Terry works, led by mob boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb). While Johnny is the devil on Terry’s left shoulder, Father Barry (Karl Malden) is the angel on the right. Terry is torn between his loyalties to Johnny’s gang – where his older brother Charley (Rod Steiger) is a top man – and his moral outrage urging him to stand up to the exploitation of the mob. What makes Waterfront even more fascinating is that Budd Schulberg’s screenplay is an allegory for his decision to identify 17 names to the House Committee on Un-American Activities (revealing them as Communists).\\nWhat it beat: The Caine Mutiny, The Country Girl, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Three Coins in the Fountain\\nHindsight’s a bitch: This feels like one of the easiest choices, looking back. And one that is cemented by one of – if not THE – greatest performances of all time. On the Waterfront “coulda been a contender” for the top spot on a list like this. The Academy got it correct.\\n7. The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)\\nSummary: David Lean directed three of the greatest films of all time, including two in my top ten. Bridge on the River Kwai stars Alec Guinness as Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson, a British officer charged with constructing a strategically important bridge for the Japanese who have incarcerated him and his men in a Burmese prison camp. While this task places Nicholson in a precarious and morally -conflicted spot, his view is to defy his captors by showing them the superiority of English men through erecting the perfect overpass. Here is a man so consumed with pride and honor that he forgets which side he is on, and only realizes the errors of his ways too late.\\nWhat it beat: Peyton Place, Sayonara, 12 Angry Men, Witness for the Prosecution\\nHindsight’s a bitch: One of the great, action-packed epics of the late 50s, The Bridge on the River Kwai is an exceptional case study about the hysteria of war and the pride that comes before the fall. The Academy got it correct.\\n6. Gone with the Wind (1939)\\nSummary: Dubbed the “Golden Year of Cinema,” 1939 is often cited as the greatest year in the history of film. Five movies from 1939 made the original American Film Institute’s Top 100 Films list. Many of these movies hold up extraordinarily well, but none more stunningly than Victor Fleming’s Gone with the Wind. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable star as the southern belle and her wily and charismatic love interest, set amongst the backdrop of the antebellum South as the Confederacy meets its ruin. The performances, set designs, costumes, Technicolor photography, and Max Steiner’s exhilarating score keep this film as bewildering and extravagant a film today as it ever was.\\nWhat it beat: Dark Victory, Goodbye Mr. Chips, Love Affair, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Ninotchka, Of Mice and Men, Stagecoach, The Wizard of Oz, Wuthering Heights\\nHindsight’s a bitch: The lunacy of this era can be summarized with the way Gone with the Wind – long thought of as one of the two or three greatest American films – has attained a patina of disrepute for the way it depicted black characters and romanticized the South at the time. The time of the film, of course, being the Civil War, for Christ’s sake. But I digress from such asinine and irresponsible revisionist politics that choose to sterilize our history rather than take the complicated and nuanced approach of studying it for what it was. While I would not argue against The Wizard of Oz, the Academy got it correct.\\n5. All About Eve (1950)\\nSummary: No one ever sizzled on the silver screen quite like Bette Davis in Joseph L. Mankiewicz’s All About Eve. A fierce and fiery emulation of swanky, Broadway socialites, Anne Baxter stars as Eve Harrington, an ambitious young actress who will do anything it takes to become a star. Margo Channing (Davis) is the biggest star of her era, and the one Eve looks to supplant. A penetrating anecdote on the viciousness of narcissism, cynicism, deceit, and celebrity, All About Eve is one of the most revolutionary and sharp-edged screenplays ever written.\\nWhat it beat: Born Yesterday, Father of the Bride, King Solomon’s Mines, Sunset Boulevard\\nHindsight’s a bitch: It is in my top five Best Picture winners ever, so I clearly admire and love this film. I would have, however, cast my vote a different way, if you can believe that. For as brilliant as All About Eve is, Billy Wilder’s Sunset Boulevard remains as untouchable as any film on this list.\\n4. The Godfather Part II (1974)\\nSummary: Francis Ford Coppola’s follow-up to the 1972 Best Picture winner remains the greatest sequel ever made. Detailing the Corleone saga by broadening their tale with two overlapping narratives, The Godfather Part II presents the rise of both Vito (Robert DeNiro) and his son, Michael (Al Pacino), as two generations of mob bosses. Through a compelling dual character study, the sequel beautifully explores the intertwined yet distinct paths of its protagonists, mirroring and diverging from its predecessor. The result is a breathtaking display of filmmaking that leaves us in awe of its expansive scope, meticulous attention to detail, and sheer perfection.\\nWhat it beat: Chinatown, The Conversation, Lenny, The Towering Inferno\\nHindsight’s a bitch: Some would argue Part II outshines the first Godfather. I wouldn’t take that side of the argument, but that just tells you how incredible Coppola’s films are. Consider the fact that he also directed Best Picture nominee The Conversation the same year? Holy moly. Despite my eternal love for Chinatown, one of the three greatest screenplays ever written, the Academy got it correct.\\n3. Lawrence of Arabia (1962)\\nSummary: David Lean created an epic masterpiece with his biopic, Lawrence of Arabia, a movie that has become influential to generations of filmmakers. With breathtaking desert landscapes, an incredible cast, and a triumphant Maurice Jarre score, it’s hard to imagine Lawrence of Arabia existing without the great Peter O’Toole. As the larger-than-life, controversial, and complicated titular T.E. Lawrence, Peter O’Toole gives one of the singular performances in the history of film. His immense onscreen presence is a worthy juxtaposition for the man he portrays – a hero in the British army who led the Arabs against the Turks during the First World War. An astounding masterpiece of colossal proportions, Lawrence of Arabia is one of the five greatest films ever made.\\nWhat it beat: The Longest Day, Meredith Willson’s The Music Man, Mutiny on the Bounty, To Kill a Mockingbird\\nHindsight’s a bitch: What more can you say about the winners at this point? These top three (along with Citizen Kane and 2001: A Space Odyssey) remain the only films I have ever given a perfect score to (10/10). The Academy got it correct.\\n2. The Godfather (1972)\\nSummary: There is not a single inharmonious note in The Godfather’s nearly three-hour runtime. Always the 1B to the film that I have listed in the top spot, The Godfather is in many ways the greatest movie ever made. The innovative use of shadowy lighting and cinematography by Gordon Willis, a cast that includes multiple Oscar-winners (along with a list as long as my arm of other amazing character actors), a perfect screenplay adaptation, and Nino Rota’s brooding and authoritative score make it hard not to place this film at number one. The Godfather works like a masterfully conducted orchestra, whose immaculate symphony is a meticulously crafted and extraordinarily integral thread in the fabric of cinema history.\\nWhat it beat: Cabaret, Deliverance, The Emigrants, Sounder\\nHindsight’s a bitch: Francis Ford Coppola’s adaptation of Mario Puzo’s The Godfather was brilliantly detailed in Paramount’s miniseries, The Offer. If you have not seen it yet, I would highly recommend it, whether you are a fan of this film or not (but if you aren’t a fan of this film, are you really a fan of anything?) The Academy got it correct.\\n1. Casablanca (1943)\\nSummary: Casablanca not only stands as a timeless masterpiece, but its screenplay is widely regarded as the pinnacle of cinematic writing. With iconic quotes like “Here’s looking at you, kid,” “Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine,” and “We’ll always have Paris,” the film’s dialogue is embedded into our cultural consciousness. Directed by Michael Curtiz, Casablanca weaves together romance, suspense, drama, and political intrigue with perfection. With an incredibly gripping narrative, filled with unforgettable characters and endlessly quotable dialogue, Casablanca is a heart-wrenching and inspiring tale of sacrifice, love, integrity, and the power of patriotism. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are captivating and thrilling together. Their chemistry adding immense depth to the complex love triangle at the center of the film. Casablanca’s wartime atmospheric setting adds intrigue and danger to its timeless allure and gives weight to a group of people who might otherwise not amount to a hill of beans.\\nWhat it beat: For Whom the Bell Tolls, Heaven Can Wait, The Human Comedy, In Which We Serve, Madame Curie, The More the Merrier, The Ox-Bow Incident, The Song of Bernadette, Watch on the Rhine\\nHindsight’s a bitch: What more can I say about the film I consider to be the greatest ever made? The Academy got it correct.\\nGreat movies possess the extraordinary ability to transport us to captivating worlds, stirring our hearts and inspiring us to greatness. Over the course of 95 years, the Best Picture winners have delivered unforgettable stories, performances, music, and entertainment that have enthralled audiences worldwide.\\nI firmly uphold the belief that art should never be subjected to censorship. The freedom of expression and the embrace of diverse perspectives not only nurtures great storytelling but also provides invaluable opportunities for us to learn from our mistakes and grow as a society. Without that freedom, art is lost and history is destined to repeat itself.\\nAs we bring this series to a close, I hope you have enjoyed the countdown of the greatest Best Picture winners in the 95-year history of the Academy. Thank you for reading along and for some great conversation. I’ve enjoyed hearing about your rankings and the films you love. Whether we agree or differ in big or small ways, that’s what makes this whole thing fun. When we communicate with respect and tolerance, we create community. That’s what makes the work genuinely meaningful and fulfilling.\\nTags: 2024 OscarsAcademy awardsOscars\\nPrevious Post\\n‘Love and Death’ Music Supervisor Robin Urdang On Selecting Songs for Sex, Murder, and Candy Montgomery\\nNext Post\\nOscars 2024: Emma Stone in Poor Things – Trailer and New Poster\\nMark Johnson\\nMark Johnson is a film critic and an Oscar prognosticator at Awards Daily under the Good As Gold column.

Greydanus Features, Film & Music 32\\nPrint\\nA still from the film \"The Godfather\" (1972) featuring Al Pacino (left) and Marlon Brando. (Images: Wikipedia)\\nThe shattering final shot in Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather, while it is among the most celebrated closing shots in cinema history, was not the original ending envisioned by Coppola. Anyone who knows the film well can see the last image in their mind’s eye: a closing door eclipsing the stricken face of Diane Keaton’s Kay, cutting her off from her husband, Al Pacino’s Michael Corleone, whom she now realizes has claimed the mantle of his late father, crime-family patriarch Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando).\\nBut Coppola also shot an alternate ending, taken directly from Mario Puzo’s novel and similarly centered on Kay. The unused shot finds Kay in a Catholic church lighting votive candles as she prays for her husband’s soul and for her family. This alternate denouement would have ended the film on an arguably more hopeful note; certainly the effect would have been poignant continuity rather than ruthless rupture.\\nPuzo envisioned Kay taking her place alongside Michael’s mother, Vito’s widow Carmella (Morgana King), and other mob wives and mothers pleading with heaven on behalf of their corrupt menfolk. This would have been a more Italian and certainly a more Catholic denouement. For Coppola, whose idea of Catholic identity was entangled with hypocrisy and decadence (“to do one thing and think another,” Coppola once told Brian De Palma, “seemed very Catholic to me”), it would have underscored the contradictions at the heart of Sicilian crime-family culture. By implicitly contrasting lived Christian spirituality with mob life, it would also have made a more traditional Hollywood ending.\\nJon Lewis, author of Whom God Wishes to Destroy: Francis Coppola and the New Hollywood, considers Coppola’s original ending superior to the ending that wound up in the film, which he says was preferred by Paramount production chief Robert Evans. The original ending, Lewis maintains, “returns us to the film’s thematic conflation of family and religion and Michael’s betrayal of both”; the actual ending “only accounts for Michael’s power and Kay’s growing irrelevance in his life.” (See Lewis’ essay “If History Has Taught Us Anything…” in editor Nick Browne’s Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather Trilogy, page 30.)\\nThis is a plausible case for the alternate ending…but it only underscores, for me, the brilliance of the actual ending. The door quietly closing between Kay and Michael—far from representing only an insuperable barrier in their marriage and their once-candid relationship—becomes a potent metaphor resolving multiple themes and ideas established as early as the opening scene and even the opening shot. In the process, the final image offers a damning last word (at least until the sequels) on Michael’s choices and their consequences.\\nThe end in the beginning: family and Family\\nThe Godfather opens and closes in the same darkened room, a home office or study used first by Vito and then by Michael. The muted abruptness of the final shot and the blotting out of Kay’s speechless face contrasts strikingly with the opening shot: a sustained, tight closeup on the face of an aggrieved Italian immigrant pouring out a tale of woe. An undertaker named Bonasera, he has come to petition Don Vito to avenge a brutal attack on his daughter. As Bonasera speaks, the shot pulls back until we are looking over Vito’s shoulder from behind his desk.\\nOutdoors, an extravagant wedding reception for Vito’s daughter Connie is underway, the conceit being that Sicilian tradition forbids a man to refuse any request on his daughter’s wedding day. During the grand half-hour opening sequence, both Vito and the camera move repeatedly between the shadowy, hushed world of the office and the boisterous outdoor festivities. Vito belongs to both settings, but the delineation between the two realms—inside and outside, shadow and light—is strictly maintained.\\n“Papa never talked business at the table, in front of the kids,” Connie will later say, meaning Family business. Vito is both a family man and a Family man; to men like him, both are important, but always separate. “It’s business, not personal” is a mantra of the crime-family world, but the personal is essential too. “A man who doesn’t spend time with his family can never be a real man,” Vito says. When Michael eventually takes over the Family business, Vito wants to know if he’s happy with his own family, with Kay and their two children. Michael says he is, but one of The Godfather’s central ideas is that the seemingly successful compartmentalization that has defined the father’s life will elude the son.\\nThe rules of the game\\nBonasera’s opening dialogue with Don Vito, and even his monologue in the first shot, provide an elegantly efficient journey from the bright world outside the door into the shadow world within. From the start this is not an Italian story, but an American one: “I believe in America” are the film’s first words. Bonasera could be applying for citizenship. He is a productive member of society, hardworking and law-abiding, and he has been rewarded with success and happiness.\\nDespite family ties (Vito’s wife Carmella is godmother to Bonasera’s daughter), the undertaker has kept a cautious distance from the Corleones—a choice Vito doesn’t resent, though he points it out. “You were afraid to be in my debt…You found paradise in America, had a good trade, made a good living. The police protected you, and there were courts of law. And you didn’t need a friend like me.” Now, though, the police and the courts have failed Bonasera; the young men who hospitalized his daughter went free, and Bonasera, shamed and dishonored in his helplessness and his inability to avenge the insult to his daughter’s honor, turns to Don Vito for “justice.”\\nThe inner world is criminal, but not lawless. As Bonasera’s clumsy attempts to buy Vito’s services reveal, it is governed by its own codes of honor, etiquette, and conduct. There are lines Vito won’t cross, or at least that he would prefer not to cross. “We’re not murderers,” he scoffs in response to Bonasera’s initial wish for ultimate vengeance. This is at best an equivocation; they are murderers. Vito means perhaps that they are not wanton killers; murder is a serious business, to be employed only when necessary. He is a prudent man, with a healthy sense of how violence begets violence, not to mention press and police pressure.\\nDon Vito takes offense at Bonasera’s offer of money. The currency of this world is not first of all currency, but “friendship”—or, at least, respect and loyalty, along with favors and debts. What he wants is to be invited over for a cup of coffee; to be called “Godfather”; to be Bonasera’s “friend”: all on the understanding that the day may or may not come when the godfather will call upon Bonasera for a “friendly” service in return.\\nSignificantly, when the day does come, it’s a further delineation of the wall of separation between family and Family. Vito’s son Santino, or Sonny (James Caan), has been brutally murdered in a mob hit leaving his body riddled with machine-gun fire—and Vito can’t bear for his wife Carmella to see how her son ended. The debt Bonasera feared is paid simply by plying his trade to make Sonny’s corpse as presentable as possible to spare Carmella the full horror of her son’s Mafia death.\\nCatholic on the outside\\nThe title “godfather” here implies, of course, a Catholic milieu. Explaining its importance, Vito’s adopted son, Tom Hagan (Robert Duvall), uses pious language (“a religious, sacred, close relationship”)—yet, significantly, he doesn’t say “to Catholics” or “to Christians,” but “to the Italian people.” As there is family and Family, so the term “godfather” has different meanings on opposite sides of the door. Vito and his family are at least semi-practicing Catholics, but inside the door the significance of the godfather/godchild relationship is purely cultural. The Church as such—like the police and the courts of law—is consigned strictly to the outer world.\\nThis is not to say, of course, that these institutions are beyond corruption. On the contrary, a bent cop, Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), is an important supporting character in The Godfather, and The Godfather Part III (also known in a recut version as The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone) is largely preoccupied with corruption in the Church. Rather, what these institutions represent has no significance for or bearing on the shadow world. The Church and the clergy serve a ceremonial role in family life, especially at critical junctures and rites of passage—weddings, funerals, baptisms, first communions, etc.—but the Church has no moral voice that resonates within the shadow world, at least in the first two Godfather films.\\nThis represents a striking break from older mobster movies with a Catholic milieu, like On the Waterfront (1954) and Angels with Dirty Faces (1938). In these films, priests are public voices of social conscience who directly take on organized crime; whether they heed them or not, the mob can’t simply ignore clerical voices. In The Godfather, the Church’s voice is barely a presence to be ignored. (Don Vito does have a passing line about how “most people nowadays” want things “like gambling…liquor—even women”—that are “forbidden to them by the pezzonovante [bigshots] of the Church.”)\\nReplacing Apollonia\\nFrom the start, when we first meet Michael and Kay at the opening wedding sequence, Michael disregards the compartmentalization represented by his father’s office door. Michael explains frankly to Kay about his father’s sometimes brutal business, adding, “That’s my family, Kay, not me.” Michael feels no need for the duality that defines his father’s life because he is on a different trajectory: a college student, a war hero, and, perhaps one day, his father fondly hopes, a bigshot in the outside world, a senator or governor.\\nWhen a surprise attempt on his life incapacitates Vito, family ties lead Michael—to the deep regret of Vito and others—to take a hand in Family business. After striking back at Vito’s attackers with a shockingly brazen double murder, Michael flees to Sicily. There he makes a tragically short-lived marriage to a Sicilian country girl named Apollonia (Simonetta Stefanelli), who is killed by a car bomb meant for Michael.\\nThe logic of this haunting episode ultimately leads straight to the closing door in the final shot. Apollonia’s violent death ripples through the rest of the film and beyond partly because she had the makings of a typical mob wife. She would have fulfilled traditional wifely and motherly duties, not asked questions about her husband’s business, and joined Carmella in lighting candles in church. After Apollonia’s death, Michael turns back to Kay, but the candidness of their past relationship is gone. “In five years,” Michael dissembles, “the Corleone family is going to be completely legitimate.”\\nThis is Michael’s bid to recreate with Kay the kind of relationship that he might have had with Apollonia; to compartmentalize with Kay as his father did with Carmella. The alternate ending would have cast Kay as a functional replacement for Apollonia, as Michael wanted, thereby undermining the narrative weight of Michael’s marriage to Apollonia and her death. The Godfather is an American story. Kay is not a Sicilian mob wife. What seemed to work for Vito—who died a peaceful death playing in a sunlit garden with his grandson, and was given a lavish family funeral—will not work for Michael, and one part of the reason is that Kay is not Apollonia.\\nThe wrong side of the door\\nPerhaps what seemed to work for Vito wasn’t really working as well as it appeared, especially toward the end. Michael’s line to Kay that “my father’s way of doing things is over…even he knows that” may have been a line, but it echoes critical remarks from other mobsters pushing back on Don Vito’s approach to business. “It’s not like the old days,” one says regarding Vito’s opposition to drug trafficking; another tells Michael that his father’s thinking was old-fashioned. Vito miscalculates badly in sending his enforcer Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) to infiltrate a rival family, and, whether or not he realized the role that Connie’s abusive husband Carlo (Gianni Russo) played in his son Santino’s murder, Vito wouldn’t have had the heart to make his daughter a widow.\\nFrom the outset Michael is more ruthless than his father. Vito preferred peaceful solutions to threats and threats to violence; Michael prefers to strike as fast and hard as he can and weather the consequences. More fundamentally, where Vito to the end of his days saw himself as a paterfamilias taking care of his family, Michael—perhaps like the senator or governor he might have been—becomes increasingly motivated only by his own power.\\nNot only does he make his sister a widow (which was, by the logic of the shadow world, necessary and inevitable), Michael also issues a chilling ultimatum to his older brother Fredo (John Cazale) foreshadowing Fredo’s execution in The Godfather Part II. His relationship with Kay is a sham—or, as Kay flings in his face in Part II, an “abortion”—and when Kay leaves him, Michael’s insistence on keeping custody of the children is a power move. (Tom, not Michael, buys the children presents that are ostensibly from their father. According to Part III, Michael ultimately returns custody of the children to Kay as part of his attempted arc of redemption.)\\nThe Godfather Part II ends with Michael alone, with nothing but his wealth and power, but his trajectory is set by the end of the first film. Unlike Vito, who managed to belong to both worlds, Michael is a Family man, but not a family man—which means, by his father’s maxim, that he is not a “real man.” He does not compartmentalize, because he exists entirely in the shadows. This is the real significance of The Godfather’s final image: not that Kay is barred from the inner world of her husband’s business, but that Michael has barred himself from the world outside. Michael, not Kay, is the one on the wrong side of the door; it’s he who is shut in, not she who is shut out.\\nCoda: The Irishman and leaving the door open\\nThe Godfather’s final shot is so closely connected to the terrible, masterful climax—the iconic Baptism/massacre sequence intercutting between coordinated assassinations of the heads of the other Families and Michael’s unflinching liturgical responses as godfather to Connie and Carlo’s baby, renouncing Satan and all his works and pomps—that it’s not hard to posit a theological gloss to the closing image of Michael shut in on the wrong side of the door. This case could be bolstered by analysis of The Godfather Part III, in which Michael’s quest for redemption finds him making an uneasy confession to a cardinal he recognizes as a “good man” and “a true priest.” For the last few years, though, the closed door at the end of The Godfather has become inseparable in my mind from the denouement of an unrelated gangster movie: Martin Scorsese’s sprawling 209-minute saga The Irishman, starring Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa and Robert De Niro (who played young Vito Corleone in The Godfather Part II) as the film’s protagonist, mob hitman Frank Sheeran.\\nThe Irishman recalls The Godfather trilogy in a few ways. There are family baptisms that for Frank have a mob significance rather than a sacred significance (Frank’s growing importance in the mob is highlighted by the larger number of people in attendance at his second child’s baptism compared to the first). Like Michael, Frank makes decisions that alienate him from his family. The world of the film is the story that Frank tells himself about his life, so we spend the whole movie inside Frank’s head—and the inside of Frank’s head is revealed to be a lonely place. A place that could turn out to be hell.\\nToward the end, in a nursing home, Frank makes stumbling attempts to confess to a priest, but he doesn’t feel remorse. Around the same time Frank reflects that, rather than being cremated or buried, he would rather be interred in a crypt. The idea of burial troubles him: “When they go into the ground,” he muses, “it’s so final.” Somehow he feels that interment in a crypt is “not that final.” The same fear of finality haunts the final scene, in which the priest promises to see Frank again after Christmas. “I ain’t going nowhere,” Frank replies. Then, as the priest leaves, Frank asks him not to close the door all the way. “I don’t like that. Leave it open a little.” Perhaps the closed door is too much like the lid of a casket. Frank knows his family will not come to visit him, and he doesn’t know how to invite God in. But he wants to leave the door open.\\nMichael, in the last shot of The Godfather, wants the door closed. It is a casket lid that he shuts on himself. “The doors of hell,” C.S. Lewis once wrote, “are locked from the inside.” Michael’s story may not end there, but it’s as damning a moment in a man’s life as I can think of in any film.\\nIf you value the news and views Catholic World Report provides, please consider donating to support our efforts.

The take-away: there will never be an acceptable substitute for speaking the truth to lies. Lies abound within this Catholic Church and the only antidote is radical truth-telling.\\nREPLY\\nTerence McManus\\nAPRIL 8, 2022 AT 7:10 AM\\nIn the book Kaye converts to Catholicism around the time she marries Michael and takes to going to Church every day with Mama Corleone. When she realizes that Michael has lied to her about the killings, specifically that of Carlo Rizzi, she goes to him and tells him that she is leaving him and taking the children to New Hampshire. Michael says he understands. A few days later Tom Hagen comes to New Hampshire and persuades her to come back.\\nOn the day when the whole family is scheduled to leave New York for Nevada, Kaye and Mama Corleone go to weekday (Latin) Mass as usual.\\nWhen it comes time for Holy Communion: “Washed clean of sin, a favored supplicant, she bowed her head and folded her hands over the altar rail. She shifted her body to make her weight less punishing to her knees. She emptied her mind of all thoughts of herself, her children, of all anger, of all rebellion, of all questions. Then with a profound and deeply willed desire to believe, to be heard, as she had done every day since the murder of Carlo Rizzi, she said the necessary prayers for the soul of Michael Corleone.”\\nThis is what Coppola decided to leave out of the movie, although we are told that it had been filmed and could have been used. But it was NOT used. Combine that with the blatant anti-Catholicism of Godfather Pt.3 and it is fair to state that Coppola has some serious issues with the Catholic Church, which means, to me, that he uses his considerable artistic gifts to take a shot at it any time he can. In my opinion that should be kept in mind whenever the subject of this movie comes up.\\nREPLY\\nSDG\\nAPRIL 9, 2022 AT 5:36 AM\\nMario Puzo was not, of course, a believer, either in Catholicism or even in God. I said in my opening that the ending with Kay in church lighting candles for Michael’s soul “would have ended the film on an arguably more hopeful note”; I myself would argue the point because while it might leave some viewers feeling more hopeful, I don’t think it is more hopeful in Puzo’s and Coppola’s worldview.\\nI think Puzo frames religion as the opiate of the women: something that allows them to live with the evil that their menfolk do. The devout phrases quoted above — “washed clean of sin, a favored supplicant” — Puzo intends to describe Kay’s point of view, but he does not agree with Kay’s point of view. I’m not saying we have to agree with Puzo (after all, I gave the closing door in the final shot a theological reading beyond what Puzo or Coppola would say about it), but for me the cynical subtext of the passage has to be reckoned with.\\nI don’t think “blatant anti-Catholicism” accurately characterizes The Godfather Part III (nor, for what it’s worth, did Henry Herx, long-time director of the USCCB Office of Film and Broadcasting and its predecessor organization, the CNS Media Review Office, successor to the Legion of Decency). It dramatizes corruption in the Church, certainly, and I’m not a fan of its depiction of the conspiracy theory about the secret murder of Pope John Paul I. But the Immobilare financial scandal is hardly over the top, given the Church’s real financial scandals.\\nREPLY\\nTerence McManus\\nAPRIL 9, 2022 AT 3:41 PM\\nI am not referring to the Immobiliare affair at all, rather I am referring to\\n1) Michael’s award from the Church at the beginning of the film, which even Kaye recognizes as tawdry.\\n2) Micheal’s giving $600,000,000 to the obviously corrupt Bishop (or Cardinal) who has mismanaged the Vatican’s finances.\\n3) Hatching the plot to kill Joey Zaza while in a Church.\\n4) The murder of Joey Zaza and others which disrupt a religious procession.\\n5) The 2 murders committed in the Vatican itself in the film’s climactic scenes.\\nI see these as evidence of blatant anti-Catholicism, you don’t.\\nREPLY\\nSDG\\nAPRIL 10, 2022 AT 10:49 AM\\nI think Henry Herx, who for decades was the most trusted and influential American Catholic when it came to evaluating movies from a moral perspective, had it right when he said The Godfather Part III “is in no way anti-religious, though some may find it outrageously insensitive to the feelings of Catholic viewers.” The things you describe may be injurious to the feelings of Catholic viewers; they are not anti-Catholic, blatant or otherwise.

To his credit, in The Godfather Part III Coppola makes Connie scarier than Michael, but the first two films are largely about ruthless men and innocent and/or victimized women.

And it haunts me still, especially with the election of “Catholic” Joe Biden as President. Many professed Catholics that I know and call friends use Mark 12:17 to rationalize their support of abortion and John 8:7 as their reason to be indifferent to the LGBTQ movement and every time they tell me that I hear Don Corleone say “…it’s only business.” As I tell my kids when they hear their peers regurgitate the same logic – Really?

I suspect that the Hoffa connection may be the filmmakers’ way (Scorsese and/or screenwriter Steven Zaillian) of having the open door at the end work within the context of the film itself as well as paying homage to, and commenting on, the most famous gangster movie of all time.\\nBy the way, this was not the first time that Scorsese referenced The Godfather’s closing door. He also does it in the last shot of Goodfellas, with Ray Liotta’s Henry Hill, in the Witness Protection Program, walking into his suburban home and closing the front door behind him.

I began thinking more about The Godfather’s last shot. Reading about The Godfather and learning about the alternate ending offered more fodder for thought, especially coming at it from a Catholic perspective, as I’m wont to do.

A morally depraved character of his did. Bad characters do bad things, and portrayal is not endorsement. This is criticism 101. By your standards, a factual report about the horrific actions of Cardinal McCarrick and the secrets of his success in getting away with what he did for so long, or about priests and bishops raping nuns or keeping them in sexual slavery while using religion to justify their actions, would be “anti-Catholic.” So would various things in the works of Catholic novelists like Graham Greene, Flannery O’Connor, and Walker Percy.

Far from saying that you wouldn’t approve of a factual report about McCarrick, on the contrary, I took for granted that you would! And Herx didn’t say the film is insensitive to the feelings of Catholics, only that some may find it so. My argument is that the premise that anything that some may find insensitive to the feelings of Catholics is ipso facto anti-Catholic is ridiculous. If I were to read aloud to a roomful of Catholics from a factual report about Cardinal McCarrick or other atrocities committed in the Church, it would not be hard to find many Catholics who would consider that insensitive to their feelings. I take it for granted that you agree that this would not make it anti-Catholic. None of the Godfather movies is for all viewers. The fact that some viewers may find these movies injurious to their feelings doesn’t make them bad movies. It simply means they should watch other movies.\\nI am grateful for your prayer.

In the said book he recalls the exact scenes (he was privy to in his work) you will see in The Godfather. And in Godfather ll. Try and find a copy, you’ll be amazed. The book I refer to was actually penned in 1962. I read this in an article in a New York newspaper years ago. I also stumbled across the book, Revolt in the Mafia.

I had a brush with fame when I was the English News Anchor, Reporter and Talk Show host with CHIN Multicultural Radio TV in Toronto in the early 1980’s. I was introduced to Francis Ford Coppola and his wife while having my daily espresso in the supermarket downstairs from the radio station in Toronto’s Little Italy. Only problem was it was Francis Ford Coppola Senior and his wife. That was my brush with fame story from the 1980’s.\\nREPLY\\nHunter\\nAPRIL 21, 2022 AT 5:53 AM\\nI usually find your reviews wise, SDG, but I think you have this one backwards. Vito is an evil, evil man. Roger Ebert observed that the reason he appears “saintly” (or as you put it, “healthy” and “prudent”) is that, as with his family, he keeps us at a distance from his life-destroying actions. The ending makes us complicit and co-dependent on Vito; we scapegoat Michael as a devil for assuming his father’s role with less charm.\\nVito attempted to play god (the central symbol is the hand holding the strings) but the opening scene shows he rules in hell. He orchestrates the physical or moral destruction of all of his children. As long as he’s there to gaslight everyone as the benevolent patriarch, we blame his children for their bad ends: Santino dies (we believe) not because of his father’s violent enemies but because he had a temper; Connie has a strange attraction to duplicitous violent men and we wonder where that comes from; Fredo is reluctant to assume the reins of a criminal empire and we regard him as “weak.”\\nThe movie doesn’t demand we be played by Vito like his children are. The closing of the door in the final shot is not a new, worse state of affairs but a return to the status quo. The only difference is that Kay is not going to be the dutiful mistress role.\\nI know you hedge a bit, SDG, by saying Vito only “seems” to be successful, but you need to call it out like it is. Vito was an evil, manipulative man. There’s an eerie parallel to the sex abuse scandal in the Church here. If we can’t call out the failures of the people in power, the victims themselves get the blame.\\nREPLY\\nSDG\\nAPRIL 22, 2022 AT 7:25 AM\\nI’m not sure I understand, Hunter. I called out Vito’s bogus claim that “We’re not murderers,” explicitly noting that “they are murderers,” didn’t I? Do I have to quote the Fifth Commandment? Can we not accept as a given, on a Catholic website, that murder is evil? I thought that could go without saying.\\nIt’s true that I said that Vito was “a prudent man” with a “healthy sense of how violence begets violence.” But the context makes it clear what I meant: Vito regards murder as “a serious business, to be employed only when [deemed] necessary.” Even my remark that “Vito preferred peaceful solutions to threats and threats to violence” is a tacit acknowledgement that Vito was quite willing to use threats and violence when he felt they were necessary. From this it should be clear that Vito’s “prudence” is simply rational cautiousness, non-rashness, non-recklessness: an ability to evaluate consequences and to act strategically, but obviously often by evil means, for immorally desired ends.\\nThe “success” I talked about was “success” as Vito defined it, i.e., success in what I explicitly called “compartmentalization.” For Vito, “being a real man” meant being an attentive, active family man while also carrying out brutal, criminal, abhorrent actions in private, and keeping the two “always separate.”\\nCompartmentalization, for me, is one of the scariest, most damning patterns of behavior there is. It allows a person the illusion or facade of being a benevolent, kind person in some spheres of their life while becoming something completely different in other spheres. Predators like Cardinal McCarrick and Bill Cosby are, I believe, essentially compartmentalizers: collections of masks behind which, in the end, there may be no “real self” at all. Ultimately each of us either finds coherence and integrity in relationship with God or we succumb to incoherence and the disintegration of the self, a process culminating in damnation.\\nVito’s compartmentalization seemed to be successful on its own terms: He died what he would have considered an enviable death and was given a grand send-off by his family and the Church. It was about Vito’s belief that even this kind of success was feasible and practical that I said he may not have been as successful as he thought; that his seeming success may have been an illusion that he didn’t live long enough to see unmasked.\\nREPLY\\nHunter\\nAPRIL 28, 2022 AT 11:11 AM\\nOK, it seems I was drawing too much from my own experience of abuse by “godfather” types in my life and read too much into your language.

Ratings are on a four-star scale.)\\nFred Astaire in Blue Skies (Photo: Kino)\\nBLUE SKIES (1946). A songbook captured on celluloid, Blue Skies features approximately three dozen Irving Berlin songs heard either in snippets or in entirety. Unfortunately, not all of the tunes are top-tier Berlin, just one of the problems plaguing this erratic box office hit. Fred Astaire plays Jed Potter, a hoofer in love with singer Mary O’Hara (Joan Caulfield). For her part, Mary pines for Jed’s best friend, nightclub owner Johnny Adams (Bing Crosby). As for Johnny, he cares for Mary but knows he’s not the type to settle down. Nevertheless, Mary and Johnny marry, leading to a daughter (Karolyn Grimes of “Zuzu’s Petals!” fame) but also to a combative relationship. Does Jed now stand a chance? It’s not a very compelling question, especially since Astaire has zero chemistry with Caulfield — she’s bland in the role and was almost fired from the film, but she was the married Crosby’s mistress at the time so there ya go. Crosby is his usual drowsy self, although he perks up when tag teaming with Fred for the amusing number “A Couple of Song and Dance Men.” Yet the film’s highlight — by far — is Astaire’s performance of “Puttin’ on the Ritz,” a superb showcase in which the magic of the movies allows the star to dance with multiple copies of himself! Blue Skies earned a pair of Oscar nominations for Best Scoring of a Musical and Best Original Song (“You Keep Coming Back Like a Song,” one of the few original Berlin compositions in the film).\\nBlu-ray extras consist of film critic audio commentary and trailers for other movies on the Kino label.\\nMovie: ★★½\\nJames Cagney in Captains of the Clouds (Photo: Warner Archive)\\nCAPTAINS OF THE CLOUDS (1942). Just as the 1942 Best Picture Oscar winner Mrs. Miniver boosted American support for the British cause during World War II (as was intended), so too did Captains of the Clouds offer its own measure of Hollywood-manufactured propaganda for our Canadian neighbors. A tribute to the Royal Canadian Air Force, this stars James Cagney as Brian MacLean, a bush pilot operating in the Canadian wilds. MacLean’s penchant for trouble leads him to steal business away from the other bush pilots — the noble Johnny Dutton (Dennis Morgan), the British expat Scrounger Harris (Reginald Gardiner), and the comic relief pair of Tiny Murphy (Alan Hale) and Blimp Lebec (George Tobias) — and to steal the fiery Emily Foster (Brenda Marshall) away from her boyfriend Johnny. But then Johnny saves Brian from certain death and Brian subsequently saves Johnny from marrying the materialistic Emily (by, uh, marrying her himself), so all the guys are now buddies and ready to leave the wilderness and join the war effort — and the RCAF. The movie’s complete bosh when it comes to the plotting and the characterizations, but the Technicolor lensing is impressive, the climactic aerial battle is exciting, and Cagney is in his element as a brash brawler. Captains of the Clouds nabbed a pair of Oscar nominations for Best Color Cinematography and Best Color Art Direction-Interior Decoration.\\nBlu-ray extras consist of a 1942 newsreel; the 1942 live-action short Rocky Mountain Big Game; two Bugs Bunny cartoons, 1942’s Hold the Lion, Please and 1944’s What’s Cookin’ Doc? (in which Bugs is livid when Cagney beats him for the Best Actor Oscar); and the theatrical trailer.\\nMovie: ★★½\\nJohn Cazale and Al Pacino in The Godfather Part II (Photos: Paramount)\\nTHE GODFATHER TRILOGY (1972-1990). I’ll avoid writing that this latest set of the Francis Ford Coppola-Mario Puzo movies is an offer cineastes can’t refuse (oops, too late). Seriously, though, this stellar 4K offering will doubtless remain one of the best — if not the best — home market releases of the year. The films themselves need no introduction. The Godfather (1972) immediately emerged as a cultural milestone; The Godfather Part II (1974) is lauded in some corners (although not this one) as being superior to its predecessor; and The Godfather Part III (1990), refashioned here as Coppola’s definitive The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone, is worthwhile yet seriously flawed (go here for a full review). The first two films earned Best Picture Academy Awards, with the original also winning for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Actor for Marlon Brando; the icon delivers a cheeky (in more ways than one) performance as Don Vito Corleone, although the award clearly should have gone to the real star, Al Pacino (relegated to the Best Supporting Actor category, where he competed against co-stars James Caan and Robert Duvall). Part II earned a total of six statues, including Best Director and Best Supporting Actor for Robert De Niro as the young Don Vito Corleone.\\nAl Pacino and Francis Ford Coppola\\nIn celebration of the initial film’s 50th anniversary, Paramount is offering the trilogy for the first time in 4K. Not only does the collection contain The Godfather Coda but it also features the 1990 theatrical version of The Godfather Part III as well as Coppola’s 1991 cut. New extras include an introduction by Coppola; a piece on the saga’s latest restoration; and 8mm home movie footage shot in 1971. Previously released extras include audio commentary by Coppola; several making-of pieces; a look at the first picture’s troubled production, featuring interviews with Coppola, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and others; additional scenes; an interactive family tree; an interactive crime organization chart; and much, much more.\\nThe Godfather: ★★★★\\nThe Godfather Part II: ★★★★\\nThe Godfather Coda: ★★½\\nMillennium Actress (Photo: Shout! Factory & Eleven Arts)\\nMILLENNIUM ACTRESS (2001). With only four films as a writer-director under his belt, Satoshi Kon established himself as a leading light in the world of anime before succumbing to pancreatic cancer in 2010, at the age of 46. The 1997 effort Perfect Blue was an influence on Darren Aronofsky, and 2001’s Millennium Actress, 2003’s Tokyo Godfathers, and 2006’s Paprika likewise have their disciples. With Millennium Actress, cinema folds back onto itself in this imaginative yarn in which a former movie star, now spending her twilight years in seclusion, reflects on the past at the bidding of a documentary filmmaker. As she relates her tale, the filmmaker and his assistant find themselves integrated into the action and witnessing history for themselves. A haunting love story, this also includes homages to Japan’s rich cinematic legacy (particularly the works of Akira Kurosawa).\\nIn collaboration with Eleven Arts, Shout! Factory has reissued Millennium Actress in a steelbook edition that contains both the original Japanese audio and the 2019 English-language dub. Blu-ray extras consist of a making-of featurette that includes an interview with the late Satoshi Kon; interviews with producers Taro Maki and Masao Maruyama; and interviews with voice actresses Laura Post and Abby Trott.\\nMovie: ★★★\\nMark Wahlberg in Shooter (Photo: Paramount)\\nSHOOTER (2007). Shooter kicks off with a scene in which a young man flashes a picture of his fiancée to his partner, which in movie parlance of course means he won’t be around much longer. Shooter also includes a sequence in which our put-upon protagonist reaches his boiling point upon learning the worst news a movie hero can hear: The villains went and shot his faithful canine companion (big mistake, guys). It’s a testament to all concerned that Shooter can include such hoary clichés and effortlessly survive them. Crisply directed by Antoine Fuqua and adapted from Stephen Hunter’s Point of Impact, this casts Mark Wahlberg (who portrayed a shooter of an entirely different kind in Boogie Nights) as Bob Lee Swagger, a former Marine sniper who’s duped into taking part in a political assassination and then served up as the lone gunman. Refusing to go down easy, he instead uses all his training to get back at the slimy suits who framed him, along the way enlisting the aid of an earnest FBI rookie (Michael Peña). Comparisons to Sylvester Stallone’s similarly ill-treated combat vet are paper-thin, since this film is anything but a Rambore; instead, it benefits from some taut action sequences, a well-chosen supporting cast (66-year-old Levon Helm, not looking a day over 99, steals the film as a gun enthusiast), and a suitably grumpy Wahlberg.\\nParamount has reissued Shooter in a 4K steelbook edition. Extras include a making-of featurette and deleted scenes.\\nMovie: ★★★\\nDiane Kruger, Jessica Chastain and Lupita Nyong’o in The 355 (Photo: Universal)\\nTHE 355 (2022). There’s a tendency to attach the word “feminist” to any movie that takes a traditionally male-centric genre and fills the leading roles with women. But that’s a lazy and often erroneous approach. The horror film The Descent is a feminist work. The superhero saga Wonder Woman is a feminist work. The 355, on the other hand, is simply a standard action yarn in which the central characters just happen to be women instead of Ethan Hunt or Jason Bourne. The picture is a sampling of girl power with a United Nations twist, as five global operatives — American (Jessica Chastain), British (Lupita Nyong’o), German (Diane Kruger), Colombian (Penelope Cruz), and Chinese (Fan Bingbing) — pool their resources in order to stop a wide range of bad guys from activating some gizmo that can basically cripple the world. The 355 is the sort of movie that doesn’t trust the intelligence of its audience — that’s a given when there’s a cityscape shot that captures the Eiffel Tower and the filmmakers feel the need to tag the location as “Paris, France.” Writer-director Simon Kinberg, co-scripting with playwright Theresa Rebeck, is the guy who brought down the once-proud X-Men franchise with the painful Dark Phoenix, and this latest effort shows the same general inefficiency when it comes to such cinematic niceties as dialogue, characterization, and thrillingly staged action sequences. The 355 isn’t a bad movie — rather, it’s aggressively average — and any lift it receives is, not surprisingly, provided by its powerhouse cast, Kruger in particular.\\nBlu-ray extras include behind-the-scenes pieces focusing on the stunt work and the production design; deleted scenes; and VFX breakdowns.\\nMovie: ★★\\nRachel Zegler in West Side Story; Bradley Cooper in Nightmare Alley (Photos: Disney)\\nWEST SIDE STORY (2021) / NIGHTMARE ALLEY (2021). Two remakes. Two current contenders for the Best Picture Academy Award. Two titles released through Disney’s home entertainment label. Directed by Steven Spielberg, West Side Story isn’t that markedly inferior to its 1961 predecessor (itself a Best Picture Oscar winner), with Rachel Zegler and Ariana DeBose particularly appealing as Maria and Anita and Mike Faist particularly energized as Riff. Still, as far as splashy 2021 musicals go, I prefer both tick, tick…BOOM! and In the Heights. Nightmare Alley comes from Guillermo del Toro, who adds the proper menacing mood to this tale of circus geeks and freaks. It’s no match for the 1947 version starring Tyrone Power, but an excellent production design and a strong central performance by Bradley Cooper make it worthwhile.\\nBlu-ray extras on West Side Story consist of numerous making-of featurettes and song links.

America has made my fortune.\\nBy\\nStephen Silver\\non\\nMarch 23, 2022\\n“I believe in America.” Those are the first words spoken in Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather. They’re spoken by Bonasera, the undertaker, to the titular Godfather, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), from whom he has sought a favor on his daughter’s wedding day. \\nIndeed, The Godfather is as much about America, and the American experience, as any other great movie is. So many movies have tried to make themselves less about their actual subject than about America itself. But with The Godfather, the idea was much more organic. \\nThe film, which premiered in New York on March 14, 1972, and opened in general release 10 days later, is celebrating its 50th anniversary this month. For the occasion, it’s gotten a theatrical rerelease, a new 4K Blu-ray set, and a Paramount+ series about its production called The Offer, all in March and April of this year. A separate movie about the making of the film, Francis and The Godfather, is also in the works. \\nThe movie’s production is itself a classic American story. The Godfather was made by a group of big personalities, led by director Francis Ford Coppola, producer Robert Evans, and cinematographer Gordon Willis. Coppola, most famous at that point for writing Patton, was just 32 when The Godfather was released, while the then-unheralded star Al Pacino was just 31. The other major star, Marlon Brando, had somewhat fallen from grace, with the film serving as his successful comeback vehicle. \\nImage: Paramount Pictures\\nImage: Paramount Pictures\\nThe making of The Godfather has been told well in multiple books about ’70s Hollywood, especially two — The Godfather Companion and Easy Riders, Raging Bulls — written by Peter Biskind. The principals were frequently at each other’s throats, with the studio even wanting to shoot the film in the present day and set it in Kansas City. \\nThe film is famous for many things: The dozens of quotable lines, the memorable sequences, and the tendency for anyone talking about the film to eventually lapse into a Brando impression. There was also the fight with Italian-American groups angry about stereotypes, which would repeat itself three decades later with the arrival of The Sopranos. \\nBut what really makes the film is the American story of the Corleone family and their arc, which is one of immigrant success, and tension between the old world and new. They were an immigrant family, with Vito Corleone (Brando) having come from Sicily in 1901, after which he built a business, in the form of a lucrative Mafia family (and also an olive oil company.) \\nThe question of assimilation is explored at length in the first Godfather film. While the hotheaded oldest son, Sonny (James Caan), is the presumed successor, and the next-oldest, Fredo, is weak and ineffectual, Michael Corleone (Pacino) is the assimilated American in the family, who served in World War II, went to Dartmouth, and is seemingly headed for a future doing something not related to the family business. He’s dating a non-Italian woman (Diane Keaton), and he tells her the Corleone gangster way is “my family, Kay, it’s not me,” while also claiming the family is five years away from being “completely legitimate.” \\nImage: Paramount Pictures\\nBefore long, of course, Vito will be shot, Sonny will be dead, and Michael will be called upon to kill — first a rival gangster, and then, well, all of them —  and ultimately to lead the family. And his education and time in the Marines, it’s likely, served to make him a more effective mob boss. \\nMichael’s arc is often seen as one of descent and of tragedy, especially when one considers his arc across the two sequels. Like so many other films about the Mafia and other criminals, The Godfather is often quoted and appreciated by those who think the gunfights and whackings are cool. But there’s much more to it than that. \\nThe Godfather, once again, isn’t just a great American movie, but an American movie about America, unlike nothing else in the second half of the twentieth century until the arrival of Do The Right Thing in 1989. And 50 years later, it’s not the slightest bit dated.\\nWatch The Godfather\\nNow Streaming\\nPowered by JustWatch\\nShare\\nTweet\\n12\\nSHARES\\nIn this article:\\nFrancis Ford Coppola, The Godfather\\nUp Next:\\nBig Trouble in Little China: How John Carpenter’s Cult Classic Was Created\\nDon\\'t Miss:\\nWomen Do Cry Strikes at a Hypocritical Patriarchal Society\\nWritten By\\nStephen Silver\\nStephen Silver is a journalist and film critic based in the Philadelphia area.

Instead, it is a decidedly secondary character, the undertaker Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto), who also speaks the first line of dialogue, one of the most definitive opening thesis statements in the history of American cinema: “I believe in America.” \\nThis is not where the story of “The Godfather” – first told by Mario Puzo in his novel, then adapted to the screen by Puzo and Coppola – begins. But it is where Coppola chooses to enter that story because in wrestling the mixture of tall tales, Hollywood gossip, and melodrama that made up Puzo’s bestseller, he had to find a through-line, a theme that would determine what stayed and what went. He found it in the idea of America, and more specifically, the jarring incongruity between its ideals and its realities. \\nADVERTISEMENT\\nimage/svg+xmlOpenclipartClose Button2013-09-18T11:23:45A round black close button with a white, thick, X in the center. https://openclipart.org/detail/183568/close-button-by-henrikhoff-183568henrikhoffblackclose buttoncrossiconwhitex\\nREAD MORE: ‘McCabe & Mrs. Miller’ At 50: Robert Altman’s Revisionist Western Is Filmmaking Sorcery\\nThe story Bonasera tells is a horrible tale of violence and injustice, of how his daughter was assaulted, so “I went to the police, like a good American,” only to see the men who beat her go free “that very day. I stood in the courtroom like a fool, and those two bastards, they smiled at me. And I said to my wife, for justice, we must go to Don Corleone.” He intends to flatter the Don, who has been revealed in a long, slowly widening shot to be listening (as we are) to Bonasera’s story, a clever bit of camerawork and composition that makes this crime boss an audience surrogate. But the Don cannot be flattered. “You never wanted my friendship, you were afraid to be in my debt,” he shrugs. “I understand. You found paradise in America.” But once Bonasera kisses the ring, literally, Don Corleone says the men who harmed Bonasera’s daughter will pay. Lofty ideals are nice. But in America, they don’t get the job done.\\nSkepticism of American exceptionalism is far more commonplace now than it was 50 years ago, when “The Godfather” was first released. But the fragility of the American Dream, of the post-boom white picket fence (and the white family inside it) that had dominated the popular consciousness, was revealing itself as the illusion it had always truly been. By 1972, the long national nightmare of the Vietnam War was slogging on, the civil rights struggles of the previous decade had stalled, and after Kent State and the Hard Hat Riot, political protests increasingly felt like potential bloodbaths. Richard Nixon would sail into a second term that November, with barely a whisper of the Watergate break-in during that campaign, the scandal that would eventually topple him and mark yet another of America’s occasional “ends of innocence.” \\nREAD MORE: ‘The Godfather’ 4K Re-Release Trailer: Francis Ford Coppola Restored His Classic Crime Drama For Its 50th Anniversary\\nBut the cracks were showing long before then, and the films of the New Hollywood punched through them: the puncturing of heroic archetypes in “Easy Rider” and “Bonnie and Clyde,” the sullying of youthful nostalgia in “The Last Picture Show,” the suburban ennui of “The Graduate” and “The Swimmer,” the marital strife of “Faces” and “Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice,” the open mocking of blind patriotism in “M*A*S*H,” and the unflinching police brutality of “The French Connection.” \\nThe latter is particularly present in “The Godfather,” which takes pains to remind us that respectable men (cops, politicians, religious leaders) are, in fact, no better than the story’s disreputable criminals; they’re often worse because they cloak themselves in the flag, or in the case of Sterling Hayden’s Captain McCluskey, the badge. Told that Michael is a war hero, he nevertheless instructs his subordinates to hold Michael immobile, and then McCluskey slugs the gangster’s son right across the face. He takes perverse pleasure in this abuse of power; he grins afterward, a twinkle in his eye. We’ve seen a similar response earlier, the slight smile that curls across Michael’s lips when he tells Kay, not yet his wife, how his father threatened the life of a bandleader. He stifles that smile, but the message is clear: he gets a kick out of telling the story, out of flexing his family’s power. McCluskey gets the same thrill. They’re two sides of the same coin, and neither law nor order nor morality matters. All that matters, all that will ever matter, is power.\\nAnd that principle is what’s quintessentially American about “The Godfather,” more than any outdated notions of family or hard work or any of the things we’re told, from the cradle, that America is actually about. Bonasera comes back because the check always comes due. Michael fails to make the family legitimate, at least in this installment, and he doesn’t have to make it respectable, because it already was. Don Corleone tells his son that he “refused to be a fool, dancing on the string held by all those big shots,” and so he became one himself, and “I don’t apologize,” because men of his station never do. Why should he? He has a beautiful home, glistening cars, political connections, and more money than he can spend. And when we see, in “The Godfather Part II,” how far he’s come, how humbly he began, we cannot help but see his as a Horatio Alger story. From desperate poverty to limitless power; what could be more inspiring than that?\\nOne of the most famous lines in “The Godfather” comes when Mob muscle Clemenza (Richard Castellano) instructs a lackey, after the murder of a former friend, to “leave the gun, take the cannoli.” This offhand instruction is such a concise summary of casual bloodshed that comparatively few focus on what’s happening visually at that moment. They’ve stopped their car on the outskirts of New York so Clemenza can empty his bladder while the dirty work is done; the car is framed against the tall grass, with the Statue of Liberty, in the distance, peeking up into the frame. It’s a loaded vision of Americana if there ever was one: Lady Liberty, amber waves of grain, and a dead thug.\\nAl PacinoFrancis Ford CoppolaMario Puzo’s The GodfatherMarlon BrandoThe GodfatherThe

home-video standards for decades, and that trend continues with Paramount’s astonishing 4K restorations.\\nby Niles Schwartz\\nJake Cole\\nMarch 18, 2022\\nIn approaching his adaptation of Mario Puzo’s The Godfather, Francis Ford Coppola has said that he saw the story as “the tale of a great king,” Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), who passed the best and worst of him to his three sons: passionate and aggressive Sonny (James Caan); sweet, childlike Fredo (John Cazale); and intelligent and cunning Michael (Al Pacino).\\nCoppola’s archetypal sensibility is the hook that makes the Godfather trilogy so compelling, an emotional buttress that registers deeply through the thorny convolutions of each film’s narrative. Indeed, one of the remarkable things about The Godfather—commensurate with Brando’s performance—is how the emotional clarity of this one family’s story so powerfully emanates through the soup of business and politics.\\nThe Godfather sees the Corleone clan struggling to hold ground on a battlefield peppered with memorable antagonists: narcotics entrepreneur Virgil Sollozzo (Al Lettieri), corrupt police Captain Mark McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), duplicitous rival mafioso Emilio Barzini (Richard Conte), stubborn Hollywood producer Jack Woltz (John Marley), ruthless Las Vegas high roller Moe Greene (Alex Rocco), to say nothing of the sundry turncoats within the Corleone family. The film’s canvas is a crowded one, and at its center is a rite of passage: the aging Don Vito handing the reins of the family business over to the reluctant Michael, the black sheep who wants nothing more than to be part of the great American melting pot.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nDuring the film’s opening, which depicts the wedding of Vito’s daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), Michael is introduced to us in military fatigues, with his blond-haired, WASPy girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), on his arm. And by the film’s end, he’s embraced the shadows outside of bourgeois American life. As he says at the beginning of The Godfather Part II, officially sanctioned politics and nefarious organized crime are both part of the same hypocrisy.\\nThroughout Connie’s wedding, the vividness of Coppola’s characterizations allows us to quickly understand how this particular family learned to thrive in a distinct American subculture. Meanwhile, consigliere (and adopted Corleone son) Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) exists to fill us in on the ins and outs of how New York’s crime families negotiate power.\\nThe gestures, glances, and tonal registers between siblings position The Godfather as a primal story of love and devotion between a father and his children, and how siblings square off with each other in trying to live up to their father’s regality. And as Caan’s ferocity plays off of Duvall’s lawyerly reason and Pacino’s exacting coolness, we’re effortlessly swept up in the intimate emotional currents that flow beneath the power machinations of a dynastic family.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nPartly set in 1958, The Godfather: Part II amplifies this complicated interplay as Michael secures his criminal empire in Nevada’s casinos and works toward setting up operations in Havana. In a winking scene, old-time capo Frank Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo) requests tarantella music to be played at the Corleone Lake Tahoe compound during the celebration of Michael’s son’s first communion, but the band instead plays “Pop Goes the Weasel.”\\nSenator Pat Geary (G.D. Spradlin) gives a speech thanking Michael for his contributions to the state. Kay is pregnant with their third child, and Michael aims to have a family as propitious as his father’s. But there’s a revolution brewing in Cuba, and political committees are cracking down on the mafia. More intimately, Kay is distressed about bringing more children into an apparatus strewn with corruption. Dancing with Michael, she brings up a conversation they had in a scene from the first Godfather film. “You told me in five years the Corleone family would be completely legitimate. That was seven years ago.”\\nMichael’s conflicts in The Godfather: Part II are connected to the past as much as to the present. The burden of history is represented by the avuncular though treacherous Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), who did business with Michael’s father, and Frank, who’s uncomfortable with how Michael is straying from the family’s Sicilian roots. Also at the heart of the film is the story of the younger Vito (Robert De Niro), who finds himself embroiled in a war with the governing mafia chieftain Fanucci (Gastone Moschin) after arriving in America.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nThroughout, Michael’s spiritual entropy is intercut with Vito’s ascendancy 30 years earlier, and while both men act to preserve their families, it’s telling how Coppola contrasts the father’s warmth with the son’s sclerotic obtuseness (ironically akin to the patriarchs with whom Vito does battle). By the end, Vito’s power is secured, his fall into criminality established as the means by which he protects his family. Michael also secures his power, but at the cost of his brother Fredo’s life, as the latter unwittingly betrayed Michael by colluding with Roth.\\nThe Godfather: Part II is as elegant as it is expansive, acutely perceptive and operatic in his high emotions. Its story is more complicated than that of the first film, almost to the precipice of becoming a muddle. For one, it’s never really made clear what exactly is going on between Fredo and Roth’s organization, other than securing some information about Michael’s compound for an assassination attempt, or what’s the backstory of Frank’s relationship to Roth’s malevolent partners, Tony (Danny Aiello) and Carmine Rosato (Carmine Caridi).\\nBut such muddiness doesn’t matter in a film so magnificently constructed, where the tenderness of De Niro’s Vito seems to linger through the conspiracies and betrayals woven by Michael, the now-dead father hanging over Michael’s final confrontation with Fredo, a scene where Cazale’s tremulous id almost bursts through the man’s forehead, voicing his demand for respect with an afterglow of understanding his own inadequacies. Michael looms and Fredo struggles to stand up for himself while still inextricably tied to his chair, and Coppola orchestrates one of the most dramatically compelling scenes in American cinema.\\nReleased in 1990, The Godfather: Part III may be considered a tragi-ironic commentary on the cultural clout of the first two films, which influenced how the public thought about the mafia but also how the mafia thought about itself. Set in 1979—or a few years after the first two films were released—Coppola’s trilogy caper emphasizes a performativity in everyday life that was absent from the more authentic dramas of its predecessors. The story begins with a sham Catholic ritual for Michael, now a billionaire businessman, being given a papal pin “for his charitable work,” which in actuality relates to a shady transaction with Vatican bankers, and concludes with a staggering half-hour sequence in an opera house, with Coppola magnificently cutting between action off and on stage to the music of Mascagni.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nReality and performance grandly intersect throughout the film, with the actors suggesting characters in an opera. Take the the grandiose gesturing between Shire’s Connie and volatile Corleone heir Vincent (Andy Garcia) as he takes her hand with gusto and kisses it. Or the “bella figura” Gotti-like Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna) and how he loves to cavort in front of photographers and reporters, contributing to the spectacle of himself.\\nEli Wallach’s performance as the duplicitous Don Altobello may initially feel strenuously affected, but his theatrical magniloquence comes to feel more than apt; Coppola shows Altobello in his opera box singing and pantomiming along with the performers on stage, as if to say that there’s no demarcation between life and theater for this two-faced crook. Reconciling with Kay, Michael brings a knife to his throat and says, “Give me the order!” It’s then that Kay, the one figure who sees through Michael’s fronts, grimaces. He drops the knife and chuckles apologetically, “We’re in Sicily. It’s opera.”\\nThe way Coppola and his actors approach performance brings up the controversy of Sofia Coppola’s casting as Michael’s doomed daughter, Mary. Her line readings are sometimes flat, and at other times awkward. But in contrast to the other players, she’s startlingly pure, her unseasoned candor making her tragic function in the story more heart-wrenching. There’s an unexpected feeling of truth as she delivers her last line (“Dad?”) on the steps outside the opera house, breaking up the theatrical masquerade over which Michael has presided. Coppola gives his tragedy a twist that goes beyond King Lear, one of his film’s models. Michael, unlike Lear weeping at the death of his beloved Cordelia, doesn’t die of grief. Rather, it’s implied that he lingers on for years, alone in the company of despair and sorrow.\\nMichael kneels at his slain daughter’s corpse and finally cracks, raising his head and howling his sorrow before passing out. The unchecked emotional nakedness is out of step with the rest of the trilogy, almost breaking the fourth wall. Keaton, Shire, Garcia, and George Hamilton’s characters suddenly break from their grieving and look at Michael with what feels like baffled surprise. Coppola’s trilogy begins by observing the charade of American ideals and institutions. He ends it outside a theater, the horror in Michael’s scream breaking apart the compound of lies and artifice this arch American criminal has built around his heart. In this one moment, the opera is over and the consequences of reality are made manifest.\\nImage/Sound\\nRecent and radical advancements in film restoration technology have proved to be as controversial as they are celebrated for the latitude offered to restorers to update the look of films. Purists, though, can breathe easy regarding this release, as the painstaking, frame-by-frame restoration of the Godfather trilogy, supervised by Francis Ford Coppola, achieves incredible results in terms of accuracy and stability without lapsing into revisionism.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nThese restorations are textural wonders. Facial definition is stellar and location details are perfectly managed. The Dolby Vision color grading brings added depth to Gordon Willis’s images, while never sacrificing their often warm, fuzzy, amber glow. (That the blacks, while deep, sometimes tend toward crushing testifies to the integrity of these restorations.) For the first time, for example, you can perfectly make out the purple and yellow shading of Michael’s bruised eye after Sterling Hayden’s cop punches him in the first film, as well as the sparks of muzzle flash from Vito’s silencer when he kills Don Fanucci in the second one.\\nThe audio presentations are identical to the ones that were made available on Paramount’s The Godfather Collection: The Coppola Restoration release from 2008: Dolby TrueHD lossless 5.1 mixes for all three films and remastered two-channel mono tracks of the first two. All of the soundtracks are sturdy and consistently satisfying, with very clean separation between the score, sound effects, and the front-and-center dialogue.\\nExtras\\nAs a bonus—and thus further stressing Coppola’s preference for the new Coda version of The Godfather: Part III—the original and 1991 cuts of the third film are included on a separate 4K disc, and to Coppola’s credit, he commissioned restorations of these versions as well. A handful of new extras have been prepared for this release, including some behind-the-scenes footage of the first Godfather and remembrances by set photographer Steve Shapiro, but most exciting are the extended looks at the arduous restoration process. Everyone involved takes justifiable pride in the careful work that was done for this release; particularly revealing are comparisons of the new transfers to the 2007 restorations, themselves lauded at the time but now wholly obsolete. A slew of previously released extras are also included, ranging from deleted scenes from all three films to retrospective documentaries on the first Godfather’s complex and fraught production to the impact of the trilogy.\\nOverall\\nThe Godfather films have set home-video standards for decades, and that trend continues with Paramount’s astonishing 4K restorations.\\nScore:   Cast: Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Robert Duvall, Marlon Brando, John Cazale, James Caan, Robert De Niro, Andy Garcia, Eli Wallach, Joe Mantegna, Sofia Coppola, Franc D'Ambrosio, Richard S.

(Paramount Pictures)\\nOne of the many reasons “The Godfather” became the important and celebrated movie it did is partly because of producer, director, and screenwriter Roger Corman. Without the legendary Corman, today’s motion picture landscape would most assuredly look quite different.\\nStarting in 1954 at the age of 28, Corman gave directing, writing, acting, or producing opportunities – often in various combinations of these crafts – to numerous first timers. He’s also responsible for the careers of numerous cinematographers, production designers, film editors, and sound engineers.\\nMost of Corman’s movies are low-budget independent works in the horror and science fiction genres. He directed 55 features himself and produced hundreds more.\\nCorman, who will be 96 on April 5, still pays close attention to the movie world. He is an active member of the Academy Of Motion Picture Arts And Sciences and received an honorary Oscar in 2009 for his prodigious contributions to filmmaking.\\nOne of the eager young movie crazy people Corman encouraged was Francis Ford Coppola. Under Corman’s tutelage, Coppola directed his first feature, the horror thriller “Dementia 13,” which was budgeted at $42,000 and released in 1963 when he was 24-years-old.\\nCoppola then went on to direct “You’re A Big Boy Now” (1966), “Finian’s Rainbow” (1968), and “The Rain People” (1969). None of these films were considered “important,” although you should watch the very good “The Rain People.” Coppola then received an Academy Award for co-writing “Patton” (1970) with Edward H. North.\\nIn spite of the Oscar for screenwriting, Paramount Pictures didn’t want Coppola to direct “The Godfather.” His directing track record wasn’t considered overly positive. The studio had bought the rights to Mario Puzo’s novel “The Godfather” for $80,000 before it became a bestseller. The author would co-write the screenplay.\\nAs production on “The Godfather” progressed, with Paramount merely wanting a fast-paced gangster melodrama, Coppola dug in his heels creatively because he had ideas for the movie, strong ideas as it turned out. In fact, his cinematic vision created a masterpiece.\\nParamount tried to reject two key actors that Coppola wanted. He fought hard to cast Marlon Brando as the “godfather,” Vito Corleone, and Al Pacino as his son, Michael. The history of the making of “The Godfather” also reveals that studio executives also weren’t all that excited about James Caan (Sonny), Robert Duvall (Tom Hagen), Richard Castellano (Clemenza), John Cazale (Fredo), or Diane Keaton (Kay Adams). As for Talia Shire as Connie, Vito’s only daughter, well, it really was a matter of disbelief: “Coppola wants to cast his sister?”\\nMade on a budget that started at $6-million and ballooned to $7.2-million, the initial release of the 177-minute movie grossed a staggering $81.5-million at the box office in only 316 theaters almost all in the United States, with a handful in Canada. Tickets cost $3.50 on weekdays and $4 for weekends. Paramount executives had gone from being apoplectic about the production to delirious with joy. The ticket sales during the film’s first run translates to $553-million in today’s dollars.\\nFifty years after its release on March 24, 1972, it’s impossible to imagine “The Godfather” acted by anybody other than the performers we see on the screen. It’s also impossible to consider which director working back then might have made a better movie. To celebrate its 50th anniversary, the film is again playing in theaters, including the Amherst Theatre and Eastern Hills Cinema in metro Buffalo-Niagara.\\nWhy did “The Godfather” succeed? For starters, Americans loved gangster films. Secondly, the ever-increasing sales of Puzo’s novel generated intense interest in a potential movie version. How would they film the horse scene was just one question asked that would be answered.\\nThe story of the day-to-day workings of a Mafia leader and his gang and their conflict with mob enemies fascinated readers. Puzo told Don Corleone’s rise with precision. He generated suspense by carefully revealing the duplicity of his enemies. Coppola’s film captured the essential elements of the book flawlessly.\\n“The Godfather” is a sweeping epic in the classic sense of the word. The acting by all is revelatory and mesmerizing. After a fallow period, Brando once again proved his greatness. Gordon Willis’ cinematography captures brilliantly the muted colors of a criminal world where the darkness of corruption casts a long shadow over everyday life. Nino Rota’s music is alluringly brassy. The movie’s editing, sound, and production values are superb.\\nAll of these elements came together to forge one of the greatest films you’ll see. However, the appeal to moviegoers goes one step further. Once you peel away the thematic violence and dramatic tension and look past the glow of visual mastery, “The Godfather” is ultimately a story about something that has a fundamental meaning for audiences.\\nThe film is about family. The importance of family. The power of family. The togetherness of family.\\nIt’s spoken in “The Godfather” by Michael to his brother Fredo: “… don’t ever take sides with anyone against the family again. Ever.” Moviegoers related to this. There’s a reason the movie begins with that most cherished of family events, a wedding.\\n“I believe in America” are the first four words of “The Godfather.” The arc of the astonishing film flows through 10 years, 1945 to 1955. The importance of the post-World War II American family was at its peak. The Corleone crime family had succeeded under Don Vito and would become even more powerful under Don Michael.\\nBringing this column full circle, Coppola’s own cinematic godfather, Roger Corman, appears in the 1974 follow-up, “The Godfather: Part II.” When Michael is at the hearing in front of a committee of the U.S. Senate investigating crime families, Corman is one of the senators. He’s billed as Senator #2.\\nThe opportunity to see the best picture Oscar-winning “The Godfather” on the big screen is exciting in ways that true movie fans understand completely. For a new generation that hasn't seen the film, this is a golden opportunity. For those who already know the movie, it’s a dream come true. 50 years after its release, “The Godfather” is now and forever, one of the greats.\\nMichael Calleri reviews films for the Niagara Gazette and the CNHI news network.

The Godfather. which opens at the A.8.C., Lime Street. next week is a jolting epic of gangsterdom. criticism of which would seem to be merely an academic exercise considering the weight of publicity and promotion that has been brought to bear upon making it a success at the box-office. It is said that in the United States and Canada the film has already lopped the 100.000.000 dollar mark in five months which converts Gone With The \\'Windthe previous highest m o ney-spinner—into a breeze.\\nThe Godfather is a legend in its short lifetime. Scratch the myth, though, and what bleeds for you? It is the story of an aged Mafia don. superbly played by Marlon Brando, who via a series of bloody murders and his son, Michael (Al Pacino) passes on a legacy of shamed honour which in the world America lives in today passes for identity. It is a gangster film without any of the pity and hatred we might feel towards such aliens in our midst, because it recognises that in all of us there is the ignition towards power and criminality. We are all part of this Royal Family, the film suggests: or would like to be.\\nThe Family is the organisation which casts its web of terror across New York: Its fatherfigure spider is played by Brando with the air of a monarch dispensing favours. He is at once human and operatic. His largesse is avenging the rape of the daughter of one of his friends, or promoting a pop-singer godson via severing the head of a film producer\\'s favourite racehorse. Brando plays him as a man heavy with what he TOM HUTCHINSON\\'S kind tight of script and mood. It lacks, though.\\nany commitment on the part of the director: It !-kiys nothing above and beyond its subject other than what is to be found in the marvellous acting of its principals. I have remarked upon Brando, whose performance has been justly hailed. I would also tell of Al Pacino, looking vaguely like Dustin Hoffman, whose steely-eyed younger son moving towards God-Paternalism is a subtle projection of the newer kind of Mafioso: A man who can make his sister a widow even after he had told her that he would not. There are others to be noted: James Caan as the tearaway brother given to much savagery and little thought: Robert Duvall, the adopted son, needing the love of the family as an emotional thing. The women are negligible as they are meant to be, because in the closed community of this Roman Catholic family.\\nwhose essence is mainly masculine, women are seen but not heard. But in these women lies the deepest flaw of the film. That a wife (Diane Keaton) should not know and recognise her husband\\'s terrible business seems to me naive and slightly absurd. The women\\'s acceptance of their menfolk\\'s trade is without question, but needs explaining. But, having said that, let me assure you that The Godfather is stunning entertainment.\\nNo more and no less. I believe that it could have been more, have said more, about its subject but I will settle for what I have seen. To paraphrase the sinister business-jargon which covers any threat and which is used over and over again in the film \"I µ•ill make him an offer that he will have to accept\" I think that it is an epic that you will just have to see. e ~, , .4v E . •-•:,:.\\nconsiders to be his duty towards others, his jaw Neanderthal with purpose. It is a remarkable, sometimes moving, portrayal of a lowly Sicilian immigrant who has elevated himself to the higher reaches of some kind of kingship: The crown may be bloodied with much slaying, but it is still a crown. What the director, Francis Ford Coppola ; has done in urging forward what for me was a very turgid bestseller—by Mario Puzo, who collaborates on the screenplay—is to search out the reality of each character held in thrall by this despot: from the women chattering in the kitchen. away from the horror he creates, to the hoods who worship him as though he were a god. Which does not make it a masterpeice; but it does create a brilliant piece of bolding cinema.\\nIn terms of filmmaking look at the way people eat.

Goldflo ger t mala reached around the table of a meal. It begins with a wedding feast and ends with a christening, when the godson of the new Godfather is given the ritual holy food to taste as enemies of the family are slaughtered: a terrifying baptism of fire, no less, and one of the best sequences of violence in the film. Men are killed at table. as though suddenly struck off the menu.\\nGarrottings only cut off breath after the victim has been provided with a drink. To that extent The Godfather is marvellously understanding about a particular cirumstance of life. But how does one explain its enormous success within America and now, presumably. in Britain? I think because, in its distorted way it says something about loyalty and courage, emotions you might have thought had been discarded in the sociological dustbin. A man can have his jaw broken by a corrupt police officer (Sterling Hayden) but not have his spirit bruised.\\n\\' Never tell anyone outside the Family what vou are thinking.\" says the young Godfather to his ageing brother when they are abort to takeover a Las Vegas casino. Allegiance and honour are all. It also, indirectly, says something about the bigbusiness ideals which the family worships: An American dream of private enterprise soured into nightmare.

In fact, Kempton was a myopic, pipe-smoking 60-year-old from Tyneside; a street-corner orator fired, above all, by his fierce belief that war widows and pensioners should not be forced to pay the BBC licence fee.\\n+\\n3\\nView gallery\\nIt's remarkable that Jim Broadbent and Dame Helen Mirren had never worked together before The Duke.

And let's not accuse him of nepotism over the casting of his wife, Anna Maxwell Martin, in one of the film's small but key supporting roles.\\nTerrific as ever, she plays the affluent wife of a local councillor who employs Dorothy as what in 1961 was known as a charlady. Matthew Goode adds further class as the urbane defence barrister Jeremy Hutchinson (whose other 1960s clients included Christine Keeler, the spy George Blake and Penguin Books in the Lady Chatterley case, and who was married to the actress Peggy Ashcroft).\\nBut it is Broadbent and Mirren who are the beating heart of this delightful film.\\nTo the end of his extremely long life, Hutchinson (who was 102 when he died in November 2017) recalled Kempton with great affection — and Broadbent shows us why, beguilingly breathing life into a kind of British archetype.\\nKempton is an idealist, a dreamer, big-hearted and self-taught. He is also a long-winded know-all, but devoted to Dorothy and their two sons, Jackie (Fionn Whitehead) and Kenny (Jack Bandeira), and energised by a powerful social conscience.\\nSometimes, in truth, the film ladles on the working-class nobility a bit thick. Kempton loses a job as a taxi driver for waiving a disabled war veteran's fare, and another at a bakery for standing up for a Pakistani colleague picked on by a racist supervisor. But Broadbent keeps it real at every turn and manages a passable Geordie accent to boot, while Mirren, whose skill as an actress enables her to play frumpy and downtrodden every bit as well as she does elegant hauteur, is a superb foil.\\nCleverly, Michell crafted The Duke in the style of a 1960s film. The split-screen techniques evoke a more glamorous story of art theft, 1968's The Thomas Crown Affair, and there's an appealingly retro score, with more than a few nods to those cloth-cap, kitchen-sink dramas of 60 years ago.\\nIndeed, I first saw it at the 2020 Venice Film Festival (the pandemic has pushed its release back 18 months) and still cherish seeing the Italian subtitles grapple with Kempton's line, as he presents Dorothy with a tray of placatory tea and biscuits: 'Good dunkers, them ginger nuts.' The bribe doesn't entirely work. The down-to-earth Dorothy is exasperated by her placard-waving husband, who also has pretensions as a playwright.\\nYet we never doubt that their relationship is rooted in mutual love — as well as grief, although they cope in contrasting ways with the tragedy, years earlier, of losing a daughter in a road accident.\\nA very different love story, without ginger nuts, unfolds in the overlong Cyrano.\\n+\\n3\\nView gallery\\nShot on Sicily and set around the turn of the 18th century, Cyrano is properly gorgeous to look at\\nIn Joe Wright's lavish musical adaptation of Edmond Rostand's famous 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac, Peter Dinklage excels in the title role, and Haley Bennett is terrific as Roxanne, his friend since childhood and object of his secret ardour. \\nKelvin Harrison Jr plays Christian, the handsome soldier she thinks she loves for his way with words, though, of course, his lines are being fed by the lovelorn Cyrano.\\nWright describes his film as 'a love letter to love', and has made a truly beautiful, if decidedly earnest, job of it; shot on Sicily and set around the turn of the 18th century, Cyrano is properly gorgeous to look at and charmingly written by Erica Schmidt (Dinklage's wife).\\nBut the songs, alas, are forgettable. From where I was sitting, they're a humdrum distraction, a layer of artifice the picture simply doesn't need.\\nA review of The Duke first ran in September 2020.\\n\\n  ALSO SHOWING\\nSee The Godfather in all its glory\\nThere have been reams written recently, not least by me, about The Godfather (★★★★★).\\nFrancis Ford Coppola's Mob masterpiece is 50 years old next month and all three films in his mighty trilogy about the Corleone family are being re-released, starting with the unsurpassable 1972 original.\\nIf you've never savoured it the way it was meant to be seen, on a big screen, now's your chance. Everything about it that has always looked great on TV works even better in the cinema, starting with the superlative acting by Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and everyone else. \\nI despair that so many films these days last at least half an hour longer than they need to (Ridley Scott's House Of Gucci is but one recent example). Yet in my view The Godfather justifies every minute of its extravagant running time. \\nThe opening wedding scene, and Nino Rota's glorious score, sets up a treat of just under three hours that simply never flags.\\n+\\n3\\nView gallery\\nIf you've never savoured The Godfather on a big screen, now's your chance\\nStudio 666 \\nRating:\\nThe much shorter Studio 666, by stark contrast, starts flagging early and never stops.

Festival (begins Fri/25) and our critic's standouts from the Oscars shorts program—all coming soon to a theater new you!\\nBy\\nDENNIS HARVEY\\nFEBRUARY 24, 2022\\nShare on Facebook\\nShare on X (Twitter)\\nShare on LinkedIn\\nShare on Reddit\\nShare on Email\\nExactly 50 years ago this February 25, The Godfather was released. It was an adaptation of a pulpy best-seller that no one expected much from. Neither director Francis Ford Coppola or most of his principal actors (including Brando) were anywhere near the top of Paramount’s wish list, but more bankable names hadn’t been interested in the proyect. Then, the film rocketed them all to the forefront of 1970s cinema, making stars of such hitherto relative unknowns as Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton. Mafia movies suddenly became a genre unto themselves, one that hasn’t gone away since.\\nTo mark the occasion, The Godfather is getting re-released to theaters nationwide (including SF’s Metreon and Emeryville’s AMC Bay Street) in a newly restored print overseen by Coppola. It’s an interesting moment to re-appraise a three-hour, R-rated, operatically-paced epic that somehow managed to become the highest-grossing film of all time (knocking wholesome The Sound of Music out of that spot) … at least until Jaws came along, three years later.\\nFor all its graphic violence, the movie was—unlike the novel it was based on—no mere exercise in popcorn sensationalism; it was emotionally complex, tragic, melancholy, definitely for grownups. Next week, a new three-hour epic is opening amidst sky-high hype, with likely grosses to match: The Batman. It will no doubt be “dark,” that term applied to comic-book movies that strike a pose of superheroic angst. But a movie like The Godfather that is actually aimed at adults (rather than stalled adolescents) is now a commercial outlier, better hazarded at the arthouse or on the home screen.\\nAnother thing that happened in 1972 was Deep Throat—not the Watergate informant, but the XXX feature that somehow kicked off the whole “porno chic” wave that brought graphic celluloid sex out of the stag-party backroom and into mainstream culture. Taken as art, entertainment, or erotica, the hour-long, ultra-cheap Throat isn’t much. Yet largely by accident, it wound up being the title whose publicity, high profits, controversies (including star Linda Boreman a.k.a. Linda Lovelace’s subsequent allegations of abuse), and lawsuits finally toppled remaining obscenity laws. The US was suddenly rife with “blue movie” houses offering “the real thing”—actual people having actual sex onscreen—even in squeaky-cleanest suburbia.\\nFor a spell that in retrospect, looks like collective mild insanity, many in both the pornographic and “legitimate” film industries figured sooner or later, there would be no hard line left between the two. OK, Disney wouldn’t be spicing up family fare, but mainstream features for grownups would have graphic sex scenes that real movie stars would be happy to participate in. Not only did this not come to pass, but the huge success of Jaws and Star Wars actually turned the major studios’ focus in the opposite direction: towards “one size fits all” cinema aiming towards the widest possible audience, with nothing that might alienate teens, kids, or parents.\\nYet porn became the great equalizer in a way after all, as technology first brought it into the home (via the VCRs and cable that ultimately killed XXX theaters), then turned the home into a “studio” for everything from “accidentally leaked” celebrity sex tapes to your neighbors’ semi-private exhibitionism. Of course, some of the latter eventually got creative, and desired the collective experience of moviegoing for their handiwork.\\nHence, the 17th annual edition of the HUMP! Film Festival, which again lands at the Victoria Theater in the Mission. Running Fri/25 through March 4, the program curated by Dan Savage features, as ever, the best in new shorts whose erotica roams the globe, spans all genres, and runs the gamut of both Kinsey and kink scales. For schedule and info, go here.\\nShorts of a different stripe—well, many stripes—can be found in the 2022 Oscar Nominated Short Films programs that open at numerous local venues (including the Roxie, Opera Plaza, Vogue, Shattuck, and Rafael) this Fri/25. Not all of those locations are playing all three bills, with some declining to offer the less-popular Best Documentary Shorts. As is often the case, however, that category is particularly rich in Bay Area subjects and/or talent, including two titles previously covered in this column: Pedro Kos and Jon Shenk’s “Lead Me Home,” a poetically empathetic look at homelessness in SF, Seattle, and Los Angeles; and Jay Rosenblatt’s “When We Were Bullies,” a followup to his 1994 “Smell of Burning Ants” in which he probes a guiltily-remembered incident of playground aggression from childhood.\\nSponsored link\\nHelp us save local journalism!\\nEvery tax-deductible donation helps us grow to cover the issues that mean the most to our community.

Still courtesy of Magnolia\\nThe other nonfiction award candidates showcased are “The Queen of Basketball,” a fond appreciation of a brilliant player’s too-brief college-circuit heyday before any women’s pro league existed; “Audible,” a powerful look at a Maryland high school’s all-deaf champion football team; and “Three Songs for Benazir,” a sobering glance at the extremely limited options for Afghans stuck in refugee camps.\\nMore dedicatedly-international in scope, the Live Action Shorts bill doesn’t spare hard-hitting subject matter, either. The sole US title “Please Hold” uses black comedy to illustrate a frighteningly plausible near-future of reckless prison-industrial-complex expansion. UK’s “The Long Goodbye” features Riz Ahmed in a different dystopian imagining of society, giving in to its most extreme racial prejudices. Two upsetting, substantial dramas of a half hour or more each are Poland’s “The Dress,” in which a cynical hotel maid born with dwarfism stakes hopes on finding romance at last; and Kyrgyzstani “Ala Kachuu” (a.k.a. “Take and Run”), whose young heroine bucks family pressure to pursue higher education, only to be kidnapped for a forced marriage—apparently a frequent occurrence in that nation. There is bittersweet uplift, at least, in the Danish “On My Mind,” whose odd anecdote of weekday morning karaoke at a dive bar turns into something unexpectedly poignant, even cosmic.\\n‘Boxballet’ directed by Anton Dyakov. Still courtesy of Magnolia\\nIf you’re expecting sweetness and light from the Animated Shorts program, think again; this year it is pointedly advertised as “For Adults Only,” with some disturbing content definitely not for kids. The closest to a family-friendly entry is Wallace & Gromit-famed Aardman Studios’ “Robin Robin,” about a chick raised by mice finding its own way in the world. But more typical is the dyspeptic humor of UK-Canadian “Affairs of the Art,” and the vignettes of rotoscoped-looking empty modern life in US-Spanish “The Windshield Wiper.” Downright alarming is Chilean “Bestia,” a wordless stop-motion exercise of blackest political indictment. It’s very impressive, but my personal favorite was Anton Dyakov’s Russian “Boxballet,” a terrifically-characterful line animation comedy of unlikely romance between a battered, hulking pugilist and pencil-thin ballerina.\\nAmong the many feature films that jostled for Oscar nominations, one surely disappointed its makers by only scoring a Costume Design nod. Opening this Fri/25, Cyrano is latest from costume-drama specialist Joe Wright (Pride & Prejudice, Atonement). Over time he’s turned out to be less the inspired director he initially promised to be than a rather decorative, competent one. Which is just fine for this subject, as Edmond Rostand’s 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac has never been claimed as anything more than a linguistically-rich star vehicle that provides also provides good transport for romantic sentiments and settings. (It was inspired by a real, short-lived literary figure of the same name, though the dramatic fiction does not bear close relation to known biographical facts.)\\nThe play has given great opportunities to numerous actors in various incarnations, both onstage (SF had its own famous Cyrano in Peter Donat’s recurrent turn at ACT) and onscreen, the latter including Jose Ferrer’s Oscar-winning 1950 version. Plus, later ones for everyone from Toshiro Mifune and Gerard Depardieu to Steve Martin. Compared to some of the more liberal adaptations to teen comedy, sci-fi, etc., this new Cyrano is pretty traditional, being lushly mounted in an ornate style with plenty of swashbuckling action of a lighthearted nature—though Cyrano does seem to kill or wound an awful lot of extras over practically nothing. The novelty, and raison d’etre, lies in the casting of Peter Dinklage, and his dwarfism meaning that the brave, bold, articulate-but-romantically-unrequited hero’s Achilles heel must be his diminutive stature rather than the length of his nose.\\nBecause such physical difference is not something audiences can ignore yet—if they ever will—Dinklage has often had to play roles that in one way or another revolve around his height. But he’s such a terrific actor that we almost inevitably do kinda forget after a while, and the flamboyant, generous, demanding, big-hearted role of Cyrano—arguably the first time he’s really fully carried a film—is a challenge he rises to with such seemingly easy grace that justifies the whole project. It doesn’t matter that this Cyrano’s love object Roxanne (Haley Bennett) or rival-protege (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) are attractively bland, as they usually are anyway, or that his villainous nemeses are unmemorable.\\nWhat matters is that Dinklage gets to luxuriate in this expansive part; we never doubt for a second that this particular French Army cadet might also be a poet, a wit, loyal but also quick to pick a fight, or even that he might fend off a dozen or more much larger men with his rapier. This actor has that rare quality of dash, as well as keen intelligence (not exactly Errol Flynn’s strong point) and melancholy depths. He comes very close to making Cyrano work, all on his own.\\nOtherwise it’s a very prettily-dressed-and-shot version of a familiar story that isn’t great, but would be quite good enough to frame a great performance … if not for one thing. It is an adaptation (admittedly a very cinematic one) of an off-Broadway musical Dinklage also starred in. While you can hardly fault his wanting to bring a favored role to a larger audience, this Cyrano remains a musical whose songs seem entirely superfluous. Most of the actors can’t sing particularly well, but even if they did, these songs (by Aaron and Bryce Dessner) would be instantly forgettable. Wright stages the few scenes you could call “production numbers” busily enough, but despite his confectionary visual style, doesn’t have much feel for dance, or the awareness that the choreography here is mediocre. Worse, the musical scenes for the most part simply stop the narrative to less elegantly re-state sentiments already made amply clear in Rostand’s surviving language.\\nIt is worth noting that almost 50 years ago another Cyrano premiered on Broadway, getting raves for star Christopher Plummer (who won the Tony) but little enthusiasm for anything else. In the invaluable book Not Since Carrie: 40 Years of Broadway Musical Flops, its section is given the cautionary headline “Don’t musicalize works that don’t need music,” with the further insight that “Rostand’s play did not really need songs, and the score would have had to have been far better to equal the musicality of the play’s dialogue … even when the songs were good, they brought the evening to a halt.” The same words could be applied verbatim to the current edition, which is worth seeing for Peter Dinklage. He deserved the Oscar nom he didn’t get, but the movie’s overlong, dully song-padded progress is ultimately less ideal a showcase than that world-class Cyrano deserves.\\nTAGSBay AreaDan SavageDocumentaryFilmFilmsFordMusicOperaTheater\\n48 Hills welcomes comments in the form of letters to the editor, which you can submit here.

Since debuting in 1972, writers and viewers have tried to encapsulate what makes the film a watershed moment in cinema history. Based on Mario Puzo’s best-selling gangster epic, the film explores connections between fathers and sons, family bonds and brutal violence, the American Dream and capitalist greed. The story has seeped into our collective consciousness, creating a mystique around the Corleones, an Italian-American crime family, and the dramatized transition of power in their ranks. Our compulsion to keep examining the phenomenon—investigating why the film is so compelling and, in doing so, adding to the overwhelming degree of assessment—only feeds its status in the pantheon of great filmmaking and storytelling. Countless words have been written to analyze director Francis Ford Coppola’s filmmaking techniques, celebrate the incredible performances, chronicle the behind-the-scenes conflict, survey its influence on the gangster genre, and situate the film in historical contexts. And writers will devote many more words to the subject, all in hopes of understanding why it continues to have a lasting impact more than most other films. The persistent fascination with The Godfather and its unchartable reach has ingrained its mythological place in our culture and history.  \\nSo how did the film become the stuff of Hollywood legend? Everyone involved in the production, from Puzo to Coppola to actors with minor roles in the cast, has given their account of The Godfather. There’s a legacy of storytelling about the film among those involved—what it was like to watch Marlon Brando work, witness the arrival of Al Pacino, and be on the set while the battle between Paramount Pictures and Coppola exploded. Given its eventual monumental success at the box office and 1973 Oscar ceremony, which ultimately saved Paramount from going under, everyone has an opinion about who did what and where it all started. Everyone wants credit, too. The answer to the question “Who or what is responsible for this masterpiece?” remains a subject of some debate, exaggerated by the desire to give the majority of credit to a single person. Robert Evans, then the head of production at Paramount, is usually named as an integral force behind the camera. Others attribute the film’s success to Coppola, the 32-year-old Hollywood outsider whose singular vision, and willingness to fight for that vision, shaped the resulting three-hour film. But pour over any number of books and articles about The Godfather, and so many details remain unclarified, occasionally misrepresented, and often disputed by those involved. Historians and critics have taken down conflicting accounts from the principal parties and witnesses, leaving viewers without a clear picture, catapulting the film into the realm of myth. \\nThe exhaustive accounts of the film’s development from page to screen might threaten to overshadow another film, except The Godfather also lends itself to layered textual and thematic analyses. It’s not a classically told story, after all, and it’s easy to overlook how unconventional Coppola’s approach was considered at the time, given its high ranking today on many lists of the greatest films ever made (AFI, BFI, et al.). The novelty of its aesthetic in 1972 has been taken for granted in the subsequent decades. Though it comes out of the venerable gangster movie tradition, it deviates from the classical template established during Hollywood’s Golden Age. Such films dramatized Prohibition-era controversies and created thin allusions to figures such as Al Capone. A long list of gangster classics from the early sound era—The Public Enemy and Little Caesar (both in 1931), Scarface (1932), Angels with Dirty Faces (1938), and The Roaring Twenties (1939) among them—solidified the genre with sensationalized stories ripped from the headlines, featuring larger-than-life performances from James Cagney, Edward G. Robinson, and George Raft. The genre resurfaced in postwar years, extended by film noir, when gangsters became less ethnically specific (Caucasian but not Italian) and concentrated on their warped psychology, such as Cagney’s mad robber in White Heat (1949). There would be few innovative leaps in the genre in the decades to follow. Like Westerns or swashbucklers, the gangster movie became another form of studio programmer: predictable, safe, and easy to sell.  \\nConsider Martin Ritt’s The Brotherhood, a mafia tale starring Kirk Douglas, released by Paramount in 1968. It’s a boilerplate gangster production of the era, notable for its superficial similarities to The Godfather: both involve a veteran who returns home from war only to find himself involved in the family’s criminal organization; both feature an extended wedding sequence (though decidedly smaller scale in Ritt’s film), establishing the main characters and conflicts that will play out for film’s duration; both also entail a character who, after killing the competition, heads to the Sicilian homeland in exile. Not only did The Brotherhood receive tepid reviews and box-office receipts, but its commercial failure translated to skepticism about any film project concerning the Italian mob or organized crime. “Sicilian mobster films don’t play,” Paramount’s distribution department told Evans, remembering other duds such as Black Hand (1950). They considered the gangster genre dead—exhausted from overuse like the Western would soon become—and refused to consider future projects until Puzo’s book became a nationally recognized bestseller. However, the shared beats between the two films underscore the texture of Puzo’s novel and how unconventional Coppola’s treatment of such well-established material would be. \\nCoppola should be credited for keeping one foot of The Godfather in traditional motifs and another foot outside them. He stood at the front of New Hollywood’s line of young upstarts—including Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, and Brian De Palma—who trained at schools like USC and UCLA during the 1960s. Movie brats all, they set out to revitalize Hollywood by working within studios to overcome the stodgy and safe products of the era. In his twenties, Coppola started out making skin flicks for experience before advancing into B-grade horror (Dementia 13, 1963), a maligned musical (Finian’s Rainbow, 1968), and a road movie (The Rain People, 1969). Coppola foundationalized his rebellious spirit with American Zoetrope in 1969, his San Francisco-based production company founded to give young film artists the freedom to experiment with the medium. Their first production, George Lucas’ THX 1138 (1971), an artfully conceived commercial flop, signaled the company’s ongoing struggle to remain in the black. Coppola needed the occasional studio job to pay the bills—and keep the sheriff from locking the doors, according to Coppola in an oft-told story. He took a studio gig co-writing Patton (1970) alongside Edmund H. North, which not only earned him an Oscar but helped legitimize him in the eyes of studio brass. \\nAround the same time in 1969, Mario Puzo’s best-selling book, originally titled Mafia, had become an instant phenomenon, selling upwards of nine million copies in the years after its publication. Puzo, a gambling addict and struggling writer, had already published several novels and short stories, some well-reviewed but none of them good sellers. At 45, he was in debt and had grown tired of writing books that no one read, so he decided to follow his editor’s advice and write a Mafia story in a pulpy style proven to sell: larger-than-life characters, sex or violence every few pages, and multiple plotlines to ensnare the reader. Puzo based Don Vito Corleone on his mother, drawing famous lines such as “Make him an offer he can’t refuse” directly from his mother’s mouth. But this is a disputed detail. Some accounts say a mobster used the line, and Puzo’s mother borrowed it. Nevertheless, his eventual manuscript became a sensation, earning Puzo a whopping $410,000 for the paperback rights alone—a record that many attribute to the highly publicized appearance of Mafia enforcer Joseph Valachi before Congress in 1963, watched by millions of Americans on television. Valachi’s testimony—complete with gems like, “You live by the gun and by the knife, and you die by the gun and by the knife”—exposed the general public to their first hint of Italian-American organized crime. Valachi also underscored a certain mythic romanticism about the Mafia that Puzo worked into his book, which weaves a yarn about a Sicilian family who pursues the American Dream by any means at their disposal. For readers who struggled to get what they wanted in life and saw corrupt systems of government and capitalism all around them, the Corleones had a distinct appeal in their self-governance and enforceable moral code.  \\nCoppola establishes the thematic heart of The Godfather in the first scene. His screenplay differs from Puzo’s book, which opens in a courtroom with Italian-American undertaker Bonasera watching as his daughter’s rapists receive suspended sentences, followed by a passage in Los Angeles featuring Johnny Fontane. By contrast, the film opens in Don Vito Corleone’s home office, a dark interior of browns and muddy blacks, sparsely illuminated by overhead lighting and some faint rays through the blinds. It’s an appropriate setting for shady business. Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto) faces the Don (Brando) and begins a speech, “I believe in America.” But he means to say that America has failed him, so he has come to ask Don Vito for the “justice” that the American system cannot give. And on this special occasion, as Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the family consigliere, explains, “No Sicilian can refuse any request on his daughter’s wedding day.” Though Don Vito insists “we’re not murderers” to Tom, the rapists will be brought to justice, just not by Vito or Tom’s hands. It’s this subtle distinction that helps Don Vito sleep at night. The scene also features Coppola alternating between Don Vito’s tense office meetings, the stuff of grave seriousness, and the wedding celebrations outside, filmed in splendid daylight with brightly colored dresses and lively partying: Don Vito’s two older sons, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), unwind with casual sex and booze respectively, while his youngest, Michael (Pacino), donning his military uniform, explains to Kay (Diane Keaton), his Irish-Catholic girlfriend, “That’s my family, Kay. That’s not me.” \\nDuring the 30-minute wedding sequence, Coppola shows Vito looking out from his window through the blinds at the party. The shots establish the relationship between business and the family, how they are inextricably connected, in that one allows the other to flourish—albeit through a juxtaposition of entrenched family values and criminal acts. But the shots of Vito gazing longingly out at his daughter’s wedding suggest his business dealings have torn him away from his family. The racketeering and coercion that goes on behind closed doors is a means to an end, a way for Vito to “take care of my family.” Though Vito is a ruthless criminal, he also cherishes his loved ones. He would prefer to be savoring his time with them. To illustrate this, Coppola gives us moments of Vito’s adored role in his family—his fathering of Fredo to “be a man,” his strategic advice to Michael, his tender last scene with his grandson. Vito understands the careful balance between his two worlds. But later in the film, after Vito’s near assassination, after Michael rises to become head of the family, the family-business dichotomy becomes unbalanced. The criminal enterprise has consumed Michael, whose ruthless approach to business has sidelined everything else. Of course, Michael’s severity comes as a response to his family’s war with the Five Families over heroin and casinos, which has claimed Sonny and nearly his father. But his scorched earth approach to protecting the family consumes him, leaving his family secondary to the criminal enterprise. \\nAfter Coppola read Puzo’s book for the first time, he found himself attracted to the story for several reasons. The portrait of a mob family proved compelling to the Italian-American director, who could imagine what the Corleones must be like in vivid detail. He also recognized the innate classicism that would propel the story into cinematic mythology, given its hints of Shakespeare’s King Lear, complete with three sons as potential successors. More significantly, Puzo’s text as a metaphor for American capitalism attracted Coppola. If the American Dream once represented the average citizen’s freedom to enrich one’s family by getting a fair chance to prosper, it had since been bulldozed by corporate interests, corrupt politicians, and crimes against justice. “The real appeal of the movie was showing family ties in a setting of power,” screenwriter Robert Towne told The New Yorker. “It was really kind of reactionary in that sense—a perverse expression of a desirable and lost cultural tradition, filling people with longing for a family like that, a father who not only knew what was best but, if a guy was giving you a hard time, could have someone kill him.” When the American Way proved faulty, the Corleones had the influence and will to correct it for people like Bonasera. In business, they were self-starters, a paragon of entrepreneurism. But when negotiations failed, gangsters could back their drive for success with the brutality required to ensure it. Americanism was rarely purer in its all-consuming need to conquer, own, and consume ad infinitum.    \\nThe Godfather dramatizes how the American Dream has failed, leaving only raw capitalism, epitomized by the brutality of the Corleones under Michael. If the family under Don Vito represents the fantasy of having the power to enforce the American Dream, criminally achieved though it may be, the family under Michael sacrifices familial solidarity for corporate greed and stability. Don Vito understood the criminal enterprise served the family, which must be protected and appreciated. Michael turns the family business from a mom-and-pop shop to a corporation bent on mergers and acquisitions—not unlike Gulf+Western, the conglomerate that purchased Paramount in 1966. The film in Coppola’s hands, then, reveals that the dog-eat-dog nature of American capitalism has literally closed the door on the family. Coppola shows this twice: first when Michael shuts the phone booth door on Kay, who must stand in the cold outside while he learns of the attempted assassination on his father; second, in the famous final shot, when Michael’s office door shuts on Kay, creating a permanent barrier between the two. The film shows that not even the Corleone family can survive capitalist greed. The family unit endures, to be sure. But it’s at the cost of love, trust, and everything that made the family so appealing under the rule of Don Vito. At every step, Michael transforms the Mafia from a gentleman’s agreement among the family leaders to a coolly negotiated series of hostile takeovers by an organization that may as well be called Corleone Industries.  \\nPuzo’s book attracted Peter Bart initially. A former journalist turned Paramount executive, Bart first optioned Puzo’s story for $12,500 before its publication. Before being selected as Paramount’s production head, Evans also specialized in nabbing literary properties for screen adaptation. But Evans glosses over Bart’s role in discovering Puzo’s book in his 1994 memoir, The Kid Stays in the Picture. For Evans, The Godfather was the latest in his line of best-selling literary acquisitions that included Roderick Thorpe’s The Detective, Ira Levin’s Rosemary’s Baby, and Erich Segal’s Love Story—all made into profitable films. Evans even claims he met with Puzo before the book’s publication and agreed to pay the author’s gambling debts in exchange for the film rights, going so far as to give Puzo an office at Paramount to finish his manuscript. But the extent of these claims has since been disputed as Evans trying to make himself appear as the film’s mastermind. Some accounts give Puzo’s publisher or members of the mob credit for keeping the author afloat financially while he researched the book.\\nRegardless, Evans and Bart approached a long list of directors for the eventual adaptation. The candidates, ranging from Arthur Penn to Costa-Govras, either dismissed the material on moral grounds or, like “Bloody” Sam Peckinpah (The Wild Bunch, 1969), focused too much on the pulpier aspects and not enough on the multiple dimensions of the narrative. Then, Evans and Bart sought to make the story as authentic as possible by enlisting an Italian-American director, and Coppola’s name came up. Evans recognized that Coppola would be cheap, and what’s more, “He knew the way these men in The Godfather ate their food, kissed each other, talked. He knew the grit.” Then again, Bart has since denied claims that they chose Coppola because of his ethnicity. He told The New Yorker, “The thing was that Francis was not the only Italian-American director I knew but the brightest young director I knew.” Like most aspects of The Godfather, the motivations that led to Coppola’s entry into the project vary, depending on the source. Not only did Bart sell Evans on Coppola by playing up the young director’s Italian heritage in contrast to the predominantly Jewish filmmakers behind The Brotherhood, but he also underscored how, if Evans wanted to make the film, he would have to act fast to undercut Burt Lancaster’s production company from tempting Paramount with a million-dollar offer for the rights. \\nFor Coppola’s part, he has since confirmed that he eventually signed on to direct The Godfather out of necessity to keep American Zoetrope operating, marking his career-long struggle to balance commercial demand with personal ambitions. The Godfather and its sequel allowed him to direct subsequent passion projects he would have never been able to shoot had his adaptation of Puzo’s book not been such a colossal moneymaker. But his lasting antagonism toward studio authority and string of subsequent flops resulted in Coppola having to spend more of his career realizing commercial productions than his artistic ambitions. At first, he turned down Bart’s offers to direct. Coppola had started to read the much-talked-about book, only to dismiss the text as trash for all its talk of bloody violence and large sexual organs (Sonny’s enormous penis and his mistress’ cavernous vagina to match). Lucas had pleaded with Coppola to read The Godfather in full, but it wasn’t until Coppola realized how popular the book was that he committed himself to a complete readthrough. Then, finally, he saw its potential as a story about family drama and a metaphor for capitalism in America.  \\nNot everyone was convinced about Coppola. The director had to sway the film’s producer Al Ruddy in a legendary pitch meeting where Coppola stood atop a table, shouted, and sold his vision of The Godfather. Ruddy compared him to the conman Bill Starbuck in the play The Rainmaker, promising to bring rain in a drought. Unlikely though it may have seemed, Coppola, like Starbuck, made it rain, but only after convincing the studio to spend more than they wanted. Paramount chose to situate the story in a contemporary setting as a money-saving measure. Period costumes and cars would increase the budget significantly, from the intended low-budget production to a significant investment. Paramount was, after all, a struggling studio. “There were eight studios in Hollywood and Paramount was ninth,” Evans wrote in his autobiography. But Coppola convinced them to shift the settings to the late 1940s and 1950s, along with location shooting in New York. It might be tempting to give Paramount praise for trusting in the maverick director and forking out the budgetary dollars for his vision—production costs rose well above the initially estimated $2.5 million—but Evans and others at the studio also mistrusted Coppola, spied on him, and on more than one occasion, tried to get him fired from the production. In Mark Seal’s book about the film, Leave the Gun, Take the Cannoli, he discovered the film materialized out of “an unlikely amalgamation of brute force, artistic choice, market necessity, genius, and dumb luck.” Part of what makes The Godfather so mythological is that it ever got made. \\nAs already noted, given how thoroughly The Godfather has saturated pop culture, it’s easy to miss how much of the production was considered unorthodox at the time. Take the cast, headlined by Brando, the down-on-his-luck actor whose erratic behavior and string of box-office disasters made him the odd man out in Hollywood. Puzo always saw Brando in the role and reached out to him well in advance of the production to ask if he would play Don Vito, though the actor turned down the part—at first, anyway. Al Pacino was a veritable unknown performer on the New York stage, appearing only in The Panic in Needle Park (1971) on film. Diane Keaton was best known for a television commercial. At least, James Caan and Robert Duvall had several credits to their name, and Coppola had seen their work on stage and screen. Brando, Pacino, Keaton, Caan, and Duvall always topped Coppola’s wishlist for the leading players, yet Evans and everyone else at Paramount recoiled at his picks. So the studio spent eight months and $400,000 on an elaborate casting call, the most highly publicized and widespread since David O. Selnick spared no expense to find his Scarlett O’Hara for Gone with the Wind (1939). Everyone who was anyone was considered, and many of them auditioned and screen-tested. But after all the rigamarole, Paramount, in time, agreed to the cast that Coppola wanted in the first place. In a story that continues to permeate Hollywood lore, Coppola eventually convinced the studio to cast Brando after recording a screen test—with shoe polish in his hair and tissues in his cheeks—showing how completely the actor disappeared into his role. If the casting process didn’t result in the studio finding a cast they approved of, the coverage helped publicize the upcoming film. \\nThe real-life Mafia had their part to play in The Godfather’s journey to the screen as well, adding to the strange story of its making. Besides Puzo basing many of the book’s major killings on actual incidents, rumors and publicized dissent add to the film’s Mafia flavor. For instance, the claim that Evans paid Puzo’s gambling debt has been contradicted, suggesting the Mafia wrote off Puzo’s debt after reading the book, which they loved and later imitated. Most publicly, Mob boss Joe Colombo led an aggressive campaign against the production on behalf of the Italian-American Civil Rights League. Colombo and the League’s voters insisted that the production remove references to harmful stereotypes—namely, the words “Cosa Nostra” and “Mafia.” Ruddy moved to quiet their campaign against the film by announcing Paramount would donate the proceeds from the New York premiere to the League; he also offered members the chance to appear as extras in the film, and that calmed the opposition. Ultimately, Colombo’s vocal agenda caused the production all sorts of problems. But the trouble came to a halt with his attempted murder in June of 1971—a gangland hit reportedly orchestrated by boss Carlo Gambino. Colombo died seven years later, having never emerged from his coma. And then, many years after the film’s release, it would come out that Gulf+Western executive Charles Bluhdorn helped Sicilian mobster Michele “The Shark” Sindona—a gangster who would later be convicted of murder and die in prison from cyanide poisoning—back Paramount with millions of dollars in mob money by contributing to a shady Vatican bank. Doubtless, whispers of this informed Coppola and Puzo’s screenplay for The Godfather Part III (1990).\\nThe Godfather’s screenplay, which Puzo started under Bart’s supervision, led to a working partnership between the author and Coppola, who took turns rewriting the other’s revisions. But the screenwriting process never quite ended. Coppola would produce rewrites sometimes the night before shooting, sometimes the same day. The actors improvised as well, creating some of the film’s most memorable and quotable dialogue. Caan invented Sonny’s “bada-bing” out of nowhere when he says, “You got to get them close like this and bada-bing! You blow their brains all over your nice Ivy League suit.” Today, the phrase Caan introduced into American vernacular has become synonymous with Tony Soprano, the complex personality from HBO’s watershed drama The Sopranos (1999-2007), a similar look into the private lives of gangsters. Playing Clemenza, Richard Castellano added the latter half to the famous line, “Leave the gun, take the cannoli,” supposedly on his wife’s suggestion—to emphasize the practicality of Clemenza putting food on the table for his family. The choice not only became iconic, but it underscores the film’s central theme of chronicling Italian-American families. Among the less fortunate improvisations was Pacino’s leap onto a moving car in the first week of filming, injuring his ankle and putting the production behind schedule. \\nCoppola’s endless rewriting, sometimes between setups, put the schedule in disarray. As a result, the budget rose over $6 million under Coppola, who insisted on doing things his way. For instance, Coppola wanted reality for the notorious scene where the Hollywood producer—who refuses to cast the Sinatra-esque Johnny Fontaine (Al Martino)—wakes up to a horse head in his bed. So the production designer, Dean Tavoularis, obtained the real thing from a dead horse slated for processing at a dog food company. By all accounts, choices like these worsened tensions between Coppola and the price-conscious studio, and some longtime film-workers on the set turned against their director. Take Aram Avakian, the film’s first editor, who veritably spied on and badmouthed Coppola to the studio. Avakian aligned himself with Jack Ballard, a studio crony sent to New York by Paramount to monitor the production. Avakian suggested that the studio should fire Coppola and make him the replacement (he had a single directing credit). Hearing about this, Coppola fired Avakian before any such coup could occur. Only the scenes shot on location in Sicily, far from anyone loyal to the studio, brought Coppola any pleasure; every other day, Coppola was under enormous pressure and came to work expecting to be fired. But he wouldn’t quit, even if his anxieties were giving him nightmares. And worse, they were not unfounded anxieties. Bart and Evans met with Elia Kazan as a possible replacement, but nothing came of it. The director told film critic Michael Sragow in 1997, “It was just an awful experience. I’m nauseated to think about it.” It’s stories like these that turn The Godfather’s production into such an against-all-odds account and build the film’s mythical status.\\nThe combination of spontaneity behind the scenes and Coppola’s vision adds to the sense that some strange alchemy was at work. Fortunately, Coppola had effectively created goodwill between the actors, who sat at family-style Italian dinners and bonded before the shoot began, and it came through in their performances. Everyone could tell that Brando’s presence as Don Corleone would be disquieting and brilliant. Pacino’s Michael was slow to materialize, convincing Evans and the studio brass that Coppola had made the wrong choice. But Pacino’s performance would reveal itself as an elaborate construction that builds gradually into a monumental turn. Elsewhere, for his film about the love of family, it only made sense that Coppola would cast his sister, Talia Shire, as Connie, the sole Corleone daughter. Coppola’s parents would make appearances as well. And it has since become a legend that his daughter Sofia made her screen debut as the son of Michael and Kay during the pivotal baptism scene—a rite cross-cut with Michael’s soldiers eliminating the heads of the warring mob families. Some questioned the extent of Coppola putting his understanding of Italian families into the film through his own. From the studio’s perspective, he was still the ambitious young upstart who refused to do things traditionally. Though, ironically, his capacity to depict an authentic Italian-American experience was one of the reasons the studio hired him—that is, depending on the account.  \\nCoppola worked with cinematographer Gordon Willis, nicknamed the “Prince of Darkness,” to create the film’s distinct visual schema of heavy shadows and businesslike sit-downs between Mafia families. But when Evans saw the initial footage, he couldn’t see anything. Willis’ photography had been too dark. The producer couldn’t understand Brando’s mumbled lines, either. The footage and performances were a disaster, according to Evans. The disappointing appearance of the initial dailies contributed to the producers turning on Coppola. Then again, this was Willis and Coppola’s plan. However unified, the director and cinematographer were not immune to conflict either, given the shouting matches that caused them to walk off the set or punch holes into doors. But if brightly colored Doris Day movies were the studio norm, Coppola wanted something different to represent the Corleones, who, on the surface, looked like an average American family. Behind closed doors, darker things were happening. Willis used overhead lighting to give the figures a theatrical quality. This highlighted the contrast between the bright wedding scenes and the darkened office to emphasize further the thematic conflict between light and dark, the exterior and the interior worlds. Indeed, the predominance of interiors implies the safety inside the family and the danger outside that awaits. Note that the assassination attempt of Don Vito occurs outside in the market. \\nCoppola and Willis instill a classicism into the look of The Godfather as well, which is why it doesn’t look like other films from the 1970s. The filmmaking represents an intricate application and unification of set design, camera placement, and lighting, arranged to make the Corleones look at once like a family but also players in a grand drama. Willis also insisted, whenever possible, on classical tableau shots that put the entire family on display—a family portrait in sfumato shadows and the amber hues of his underexposed film stock. Coppola and Willis’ visual agenda not only conveys a story that feels like history unfolding onscreen but also builds the narrative’s thematic underpinnings about the Mafia as a capitalist enterprise. In his monograph for the British Film Institute, Jon Lewis notes how Coppola stages sit-downs between family members like a corporate negotiation. Vito announces, with the cadence of an executive looking to broker a deal, “I hoped that we could come here and reason together. And as a reasonable man, I’m willing to do whatever’s necessary to find a peaceful solution to these problems.” The tactic makes these tableau scenes feel momentous, giving them the sense of a myth in the making. The same is true of scenes blocked around Michael, who wields a different strategy used by ruthless business people to control the room and subtly influence others. Michael isn’t his father’s outwardly humble businessman; he’s an unforgiving tactician bent on taking over the competition. \\nRegardless of Coppola and Willis’ entrenched visual and thematic organization, everyone on the studio side was telling Coppola that what he was doing was wrong and terrible. Only the occasional outsider boosted Coppola’s confidence that his instincts had produced something incredible. For example, when Coppola asked screenwriter Robert Towne to help write a scene between Don Vito and Michael to set the stakes, he showed the famed Hollywood script doctor and later Oscar-winner for Chinatown (1974) some early footage. Towne—who wrote the only scene that finds Don Vito and Michael conferring about business and family, a strategic piece of plotting and character building—was floored and told Coppola it was “amazing.” As for the final cut, Coppola turned in a version that ran just over two hours, following Evans’ warning that the studio would take the picture out of Coppola’s hands if it ran longer. Evans claims he was responsible for insisting on the three-hour version after Coppola trimmed the footage too short, leaving out so many of the memorable scenes the head of production had seen in the dailies. Coppola insists he always wanted a longer version, but he cut the picture short to accommodate the studio on Evans’ orders. But this is just one example of the many disagreements between the director and Evans, who also said he fired Coppola four times from the set. When things went wrong, they played the blame game. When things went right, Coppola and Evans both claimed the credit in one of Hollywood’s most vocal and lasting feuds, leaving history and self-promotion inseparable. Producer Frank Yablans, who oversaw the marketing and distribution of the film, offered his perspective in Peter Biskind’s Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, saying that Evans “created a myth that he produced The Godfather. Evans did not save The Godfather. Evans did not make The Godfather. That is a total figment of his imagination.” These disputes and finger-pointing would continue for years, underlining how strange it is that The Godfather feels so intentional in every choice for most fans and critics. \\nThe film’s strategic slow release into theaters, compounded by exultant praise from nearly every prominent critic from Variety to Pauline Kael to Vincent Canby, resulted in a major box-office success for Paramount. The film opened in March and remained in theaters for much of 1972, earning upwards of $250 million worldwide. The Godfather was credited with not only saving the studio but saving the struggling film industry by reminding everyone that art and commerce could work in unison. David Lean, director of Lawrence of Arabia (1962), wrote Coppola and told him, “Your film is a real shot in the arm for anyone who loves our medium.” The rarity of The Godfather is that, even though Coppola was a director-for-hire at the outset, it became a blend of uncompromising artistry and commercial success. “A work of art that is also a blockbuster,” as Seal described it in his book. Kael wrote something similar: “If there was ever a great example of how the best popular movies come out as a merger of commerce and art, The Godfather it is.” The film’s triumph continued into 1973 on Oscar night. Nominated for ten Academy Awards, The Godfather did not win the most awards that night; Bob Fosse’s Cabaret won eight statues. But The Godfather won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium for Puzo and Coppola, and Best Actor for Brando. The accolades continued for years to come. In 1998, the American Film Institute ushered in the new millennium with a list of the 100 greatest films of all time. The Godfather came in third after Casablanca (1942) and the list’s highest-ranked Citizen Kane (1941). When they reordered the list in 2007, it moved up a spot ahead of Casablanca. \\nBeyond money and awards, the film turned out iconic performances and catapulted the careers of Pacino, Keaton, and many others; reignited Brando’s reputation; and turned Coppola into Paramount’s golden child for the remainder of the 1970s. They quickly signed the director to two sequels, gave him the freedom to make The Conversation before The Godfather Part II (both in 1974), and earned him enough clout to finance another passion project with United Artists, Apocalypse Now (1979). And The Godfather has sustained Coppola’s legend and career in the decades since. He continues to revisit the trilogy—a seemingly endless wellspring of financial opportunity with new restorations, home video releases, alternate cuts, and anniversaries. Sometimes, he seems compelled by his artistic desire; other times, he’s obligated by Paramount to revisit their enduring cash cow: the made-for-TV chronological cut, the 2018 “Coppola Restoration” consisting of a new audio and visual cleanup, and The Death of Michael Corleone in 2020 to give his underrated Part III another shot. In a stroke of irony, Coppola’s film decrying the dangers and corruptibility of capitalism has been his most enduring financial reservoir. And each time Coppola returns to it, The Godfather and its sequels create a renewed interest among moviegoers through this wide array of cuts and visual presentations. Upon the time of this essay, the film celebrates its 50th anniversary, prompting a new 4K restoration, theatrical rerelease, and physical media boxed set.  \\nThe film has also become a source of endless references, spoofs, and parodies. But none gets to the core of The Godfather better than You’ve Got Mail (1998), Nora Ephron’s remake of the Ernst Lubitsch comedy The Shop Around the Corner (1940). Ephron, who was married to Goodfellas (1990) and Casino (1995) author and screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi from 1987 until her death in 2012, had an affinity for gangster subjects despite her tendency to favor romantic comedies. Her screenplay of My Blue Heaven (1990) was a Steve Martin comedy based on the life of mobster and FBI informant Henry Hill, the same figure portrayed in Goodfellas. For You’ve Got Mail, Ephron not only quotes The Godfather at length, but her film follows a similar thematic trajectory. In the lighthearted rom-com, Tom Hanks’ corporate bookstore owner exchanges anonymous emails with Meg Ryan, a clerk at a small, privately owned bookshop he will soon put out of business. Not realizing he’s her competition, she asks for business advice, and he tells her to “Go to the mattresses.” He explains the line is from The Godfather, which he calls “the I Ching,” and explains further: “The Godfather is the sum of all wisdom. The Godfather is the answer to any question. What should I pack for my summer vacation? ‘Leave the gun, take the cannoli.’ What day of the week is it? ‘Maunday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday.’ And the answer to your question is ‘Go to the mattresses.’” Besides using the film as a quotable source of wisdom, Ephron recognizes Coppola’s theme about capitalism crushing sentimental notions of family, mom-and-pop businesses, and Old World ties, represented by Ryan’s modest bookstore. Of course, Hanks and Ryan end up together in the film, but only after Hanks’ corporation puts Ryan’s shop out of business. You’ve Got Mail captures the same brutality of Michael’s underworld takeover—with all the charm Ephron, Hanks, and Ryan can muster, which is a lot—while also acknowledging The Godfather’s status in American culture as a mythic text and reference point. \\nMoreover, The Godfather redefined the audience’s understanding of screen gangsters, established by classical Hollywood archetypes. Although the broad descriptions of organized crime explored by studios such as Warner Bros. in the ’30s and ’40s portrayed sensational violence with a moralizing message demanded by the Production Code, it’s easier to watch The Godfather and find the Corleone’s world appealing. Vito controls a small empire from his living room, and for people who feel powerless in their everyday lives, that’s a very attractive notion. Coppola admitted, “People love to read about an organization that’s really going to take care of us… When the courts fail you and the whole American system fails you, you can go to Don Corleone and get justice.” In his critical biography about Coppola, Peter Cowie notes that the Don’s “dignified” and “courtly behavior” tends to romanticize the character, ignoring the real-life violence and uncouth behavior of Mafia leaders recorded in court hearings. As with many subsequent gangster films, representation is often mistaken as a glamorization of the Mafia’s code of violence. \\nFor a film about Michael destroying his family and straying from his father’s example to keep the business afloat, the idea that anyone could interpret the story as romantic remains curious. Perhaps the scenes detailing Vito’s backstory in Part II lend a romantic, rise-to-power narrative appeal. But the attractive prospect of the Corleone family’s self-empowerment, which is nonetheless marked by violence, ends with Vito. He sought to balance his family’s prosperity and his criminal enterprise. Viewers who argue that Part II is the superior film fail to recognize that the original says everything the story needed to say in this regard: The Corleones transform from a family into a business. The second film, albeit another landmark, reinforces the point through further narrative examples and a closer character study, building upon ideas conclusively established in its predecessor. One hesitates to call it redundant because, as it further illustrates that Michael has strayed from his father’s path, it deepens the myth of the Corleones. But there’s a quality about the original that feels singular, whereas the sequels feel innately secondary and tertiary. Indeed, along with the two sequels, countless other films about the Mafia followed The Godfather. But none, including Martin Scorsese’s brilliant inclusions in the genre—Goodfellas, Casino, The Irishman (2019)—boast the same classical themes and iconography that elevate Coppola’s film to the stuff of American myth. \\nThe Godfather feels so essential to American cinema and mythology because it draws from established motifs in a grand tradition. If it feels ingrained into American storytelling, it might be because Puzo based his book on a Western, the only true American genre—1910’s The Heritage of the Desert, by Zane Grey. Readers and moviegoers had become accustomed to rooting for well-meaning outlaws and gunslingers who carved out a place for themselves in the Wild West. The gangster genre, Puzo recognized, was a variation on that theme. Puzo’s material deals in vast imagery and themes, from the baptism sequence that combines Christian motifs with murder and hostile takeover to Michael giving up his immortal soul to beat his competition. Coppola turns the story into an epic about universal generational conflicts that occur in a succession, when the former leader must give up their power for the next in line. Michael’s capitalist mindset and decidedly American way of doing business set aside his father’s Old World approach. Such imposing themes are bolstered by the lore surrounding its unlikely journey to the screen. The blended soup of conflicting accounts and behind-the-scenes drama, all of which has received as much coverage as the film itself, further engrains the film into the status of myth, inspiring a new tradition of storytelling about its production and legacy. Five decades later, The Godfather still resonates with the paradigm shifts from one generation to the next, still influences one filmmaker after another, and continues to be the foundation of a lasting mythology. \\n(Editor’s Note: This essay was commissioned on Patreon.

When discussing masterpieces, cinephiles often bring up Gone With The Wind, Casablanca, and Citizen Kane. While those films are deserving of that label, one film as always stood out for me as the definitive masterpiece. As The Godfather celebrates its 45th anniversary this year, the one constant over the past four decades is that this film is not only transcendent of a genre but one that has helped shaped the foundation of American cinema, the must have qualifications for a true masterpiece.\\nWhat can be said about The Godfather that has not already been said?\\nAt the forefront, The Godfather seems like another mob film and while its premise is quite simplistic as it is centered around the Cosa Nostra or the Sicilian mafia in layman’s terms, The Godfather is more than that. A film about the ideology of family and respect. All acts done in the film are to protect the family and keep respect. This theme is brilliantly captured in the opening scene, where we open at a wedding; the wedding of Vito Corleone’s daughter, Connie.\\nAfter Nino Rota’s masterful theme sets the tone, the film opens with Bonasera, who asks the Don to commit murder for money, which he feels disrespected by the request.\\n“I understand. You found paradise in America. You had a good trade, you made a good living. The police protected you and there were courts of law. So you didn’t need a friend like me. Now you come and say “Don Corleone, give me justice.” But you don’t ask with respect. You don’t offer friendship. You don’t even think to call me “Godfather.” You come into my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder – for money.”\\nThe opening scene captures the essence of what the film is really about. To most, the Corleones’ actions throughout are heinous, however, director Francis Ford Coppola is able to turn this family into the protagonist of the film and by the film’s end, we as cinephiles understand why the Corleones have these values. A testament to Coppola’s masterful direction of this film.\\nWhile the script is as good as it comes, these words must be taken off the page and put on the big screen. Cue one of the finest ensembles ever put together on film. The performances in The Godfather are close to perfect. From James Cann as the hot-tempered Sonny to Robert Duvall as trusted lawyer Tom Hagen, to the late, great John Cazale as the lovable Fredo, there is a character for everyone to love and connect with in The Godfather.\\nAs with any film, there is always a performance that stands out as best in show. It is no surprise that The Godfather has two performances that not only steal the film but have stood the test of time as two of the finest performances of all time. Marlon Brando in his Academy Award-winning performance as Don Vito Corleone. From his look to stuffing his cheeks with cotton, Brando reinvents himself in this role and shows once again why he is considered to be one if not the greatest actors of all time.\\nThen comes that newcomer Al Pacino. His breathtaking transformation from war hero to Don is a joy to watch. The Michael Corleone in the first 20 minutes of the film, who needed nothing but the love of Kay to the ruthless leader of the Corleone family who will do what is necessary to protect his family shows the depth of Pacino’s performance as his mindset and motivations for his character changes throughout. Spoiler Alert! This is not even Pacino’s best performance in the series, which is a testament to not only how good he is in this film but in its sequel.\\nThe Godfather is a rarity in film as every element off and on screen work here. From its script all the way down to its cinematography, this film is simply perfect. Coppola’s ability to bring psychological depth and understanding was unprecedented at the time for a “mob film” and has only been matched by The Godfather Part II. To the surprise of no one, the film took home 3 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay. Like one of Don Vito Corleone’s offers, The Godfather is simply a film no one could refuse.\\nReel Talk gives The Godfather 4 Reels\\n  #TBT Reel Review\\nal pacino\\nCasablanca\\nCitizen Kane\\nCorleone Family\\nDavid Gonzalez Reviews\\nfilm review\\nGoat\\nGone With The Wind\\nGreatest Film\\nmarlon brando\\nMichael Corleone\\nmovie review\\nreel reviews\\nreel talk\\nReel TBT Reviews\\nTBT\\nThe Godfather\\nThe Godfather Movie Review\\nVito Corleone\\n0\\n374\\nPREVIOUS POST\\nReel Review: xXx: Return of Xander Cage\\nNEXT ARTICLE\\nWhy Amy Adams Deserved An Oscar Nomination For Arrival\\nDavid Gonzalez\\nDavid Gonzalez is the founder and chief film critic of The Cinematic Reel (formally Reel Talk Inc.) and host of the Reel Chronicles and Chop Talk podcasts.

But when they sat down for their Sacred Cow review, the answer was pretty simple: it didn’t actually matter if there is anything new to say; what mattered was the pleasure of watching - and talking about - something so thematically rich, so brilliantly shot and directed, and so damn well acted. (It’s the longest review in the history of the show.)\\nAnd, as it turns out, maybe there were a couple of new things to say about Coppola\\'s masterpiece. Adam has some thoughts about the film as a product of the Vietnam era. And Josh makes the bold suggestion that “The Godfather” could have been an even stronger film if it had paid just a little more attention to one of its more tangential characters. Also: has Al Pacino’s Michael Corleone ever been compared to “Terminator 2\"’s T-1000?

James Wegg\\nPublish Date: December 28, 2021\\n\\nsearch\\nGoing, going...gone\\nMario Puzo’s authentic writing coupled with Francis Ford Coppola’s cinematic acumen, produced three films (1972, 1974, 1990) for the ages. Not surprisingly, the first two took home many accolades including Best Picture awards. The third? Not so much—all good things must come to an end.\\nAs long as the productions are (~3 hours each), I will attempt to encapsulate the award winners in just a single sentence; more explanations are needed for the third.\\nThe Godfather Part I\\n1972\\nMarlon Brando gives a bravura, dusty-voice performance in the title role as the Sicilian who harvests favours from all comers, only to ask them to be paid back—frequently with bloody interest; the coda’s christening/murderously settling of scores sequence is difficult to watch, but brilliantly shot and edited; speaking of scores, Nino Rota hits a musical homerun—even better than his contributions to Franco Zeffirelli’s Romeo and Juliet (cross-reference below).\\nThe Godfather Part II\\n1974\\nBrando is missed—even as a cameo in the backstory scenes; Pacino most certainly comes into his own, delivering a performance of a lifetime; rather than “better than the original”; too frequent toing and froing weaken the overall dramatic drive/arch; the final scene of an “abandoned” Michael seems so appropriate after waiting for his momma’s passing to allow his traitorous brother’s murder: no worries, “It’s only business.”\\nThe Godfather Part III\\n1990\\n“It’s just business”\\nFrom the opening scene, even as the familiar trumpet heralds the next installment of the Corleone Family saga, there’s an immediate feeling of “Why are we here—was it just business (not the actual mafia, but Paramount, Coppola and Puzo all in need of cash)?” Even if Robert Duvall had swallowed his monetary pride and agreed to appear (B.J. Harrison was created to take on the mantle of Family lawyer; George Hamilton’s portrayal seems like solicitor without briefs), the wandering, Pope-filled narrative can’t hold a candle—blessed or not—to its predecessors.\\nMost insulting of all was the climactic opera house sequence (Cavalleria Rusticana—with an assist from the legendary opera/film director, Franco Zeffirelli), where star tenor Antony Corleone is shown singing from a music score in his backstage work (no opera stars worth their salt would appear “on book”), then, appears in costume in the theatre’s foyer after the final curtain has fallen—equally ridiculous in the real world of opera. Not even the de rigueur closing bloodbath could forgive those sins—even if the Pope had survived to hear the confessions of all those in charge.

Despite glory as the most celebrated painter of his own time, Caravaggio faded from mass popularity after his fall from grace and death in 1610. Less than 100 records document his life; instead, historians, critics, and fans interpret what they can from paintings—also fewer than 100. This gives director Derek Jarman flexibility in deciding a sex life for his protagonist. He imagines events that interact with some record, but like most filmmakers, relies heavily on the first word of any “Inspired by true events” claim. Jarman’s best achievement in the film comes from recreating the staging of Caravaggio paintings. Lighting, colors, and sets mix beautifully along with the faces and figures of such renowned performers as Tilda Swinton and Sean Bean. Jarman shot on studio stages in Great Britain, but the images he recreates hang in multiple locations throughout the world.\\nGame of Thrones, 2011 & 2012, with families protecting and expanding their powers to rule the Seven Kingdoms. Watching every Game of Thrones episode involves a completely empty schedule and dedicated binge-watching skills covering eight seasons full of power struggles and carnage.  The series joins Caravaggio in making dark themes and violence intriguingly visual, with beheadings particularly popular. An itinerary for Games pilgrims includes Malta  (home to two spectacular Caravaggio paintings).  Seasons 1 and 2 highlight the series’ inventive, medieval-looking timeline in places like Mdina on the main island. The Kings Landing Gate at the former capital’s city wall takes no special effort to find, nor does the city’s Pjazza Mesquite, which served as setting for a vicious fight. Visitors to Valetta can look across the sea to Fort Manoel, shown in Episode 9 of the first season. Gamers used to admire the Azure Window rock formation on Gozo, but it collapsed in 2017, making it impossible to recreate the first episode’s striking wedding featuring Acquaman’s Jason Momoa and Emilia Clark. True pilgrims can take a full-day Game of Thrones tour, designed and led by locals who appeared on the show. Guides promise views of forts, parkland, and streets found for the Red Keep and Kings Landing, plus offer insider trivia. Someone like Caravaggio could easily fit into a Game of Thrones world.  Following murder charges in Rome, the artist hoped to redefine himself on Malta, a history that led to one of the world’s greatest paintings that remains on site in a local cathedral. But he overstepped and fled, only to die under mysterious circumstances in Tuscany. Though Malta seems off the beaten path, it boasts a long list of film credits, including the hugely expensive Troy with Brad Pitt. Investing in water tanks for the film industry, Malta drew Raise the Titanic and Popeye. The latter’s sets remain open to visitors as Popeye Village theme park.\\nGibson’s Passion (GP?), 2004, or Pasolini’s Gospel (PG?), 1964 with Jesus preaching and dying in Jerusalem. GP and PG share multiple traits: They follow the same source, filmed in Italy’s Matera, and feature influence by Caravaggio. Yet the two takes on Jesus leave entirely different impressions. Pier Paolo Pasolini’s Gospel According to St. Matthew shows up on lists of “best arthouse films” ever made, while Mel Gibson’s Passion of the Christ ended up a box office miracle earning more than\\n$400 million. Pasolini’s work at times feels like a silent film, with static black-and white images and handheld camera movements. Sound comes from dialogue and voice-over taken directly from “The Gospel of Matthew” rather than an organized screenplay. Not to say Gibson took an easy course—he presented his film in Aramaic. Like Caravaggio,\\nboth Pasolini and Gibson pay attention to contrasts of light. They also focus on faces and reactions to cruel deeds. But while Pasolini pulls his camera away from the crunching and stabbing of thorns, whips, and nails, Gibson showcases the moment of impact. That may make him the closer Caravaggio cohort.\\nGodfather, 1972, with Marlon Brando and Al Pacino illuminated in scenes that look right out of a Caravaggio painting. I know, I know, discussing filming locations means The Godfather and its two follow-ups belong in sections about Manhattan or Sicily or Hollywood or my home state Nevada. But The Godfather redefined concepts of Mob movies by standing out artistically, and that comes partly from its distinct look, as deep browns and blacks contrast with light and golden tints reminiscent of Caravaggio. The artist never painted someone in a bed drenched by a horse’s head oozing blood…but he could have. Violence and beauty indelibly combine in the dark visions of both Michelangelo Merisi and Frances Ford Coppola.\\nMean Streets, 1973 with Harvey Keitel aiming to move up in Little Italy’s mob world.\\nIn his excellent biography of Caravaggio, Andrew Graham-Dixon emphasizes the artist’s\\ncinematic impact during an interview with director Martin Scorsese. The director clarifies how a painting like Rome’s “Judith and Holofernes” focuses on an event’s action as it occurs. “You sort of come on the scene midway, and you’re immersed in it,” said Scorsese. He specifically credits “The Calling of Saint Matthew” for his staging of the introductory bar scene in Mean Streets, the movie that set him on course as one of cinema’s great tellers of crime stories. Another Scorsese film, The Last Temptation of Christ, falls into the “Cinema Caravaggio” category in both subject and tone.\\nSubjectively, it covers events found on the artist’s canvasses. Also, by allowing actors to maintain a mix of regional accents, Scorsese gave the movie an au courant quality, resembling Caravaggio’s tendency for using street people wearing clothes of his era to portray classic Biblical figures.\\nSeventh Seal, 1957 with Max Von Sydow returning home from the Crusades. Fascinated by pictures he saw on a church wall, Ingmar Bergman first wrote a play called Wood Painting, then expanded its allegorical ideas on film with The Seventh Seal. The film proved revolutionary, telling a compelling story while seeking answers to life’s biggest questions. Famous for images of Death playing chess with a knight, the story includes a segment where a squire hangs out with an artist who works on a wood painting. Starkly contrasting lighting and carefully staged shots bring Caravaggio to mind, especially during a confession through bars resembling those in “The Beheading of John the Baptist.” Sets for the Knight’s castle interiors look much like that painting’s dungeon. No one mentions Caravaggio in supplemental material presented along with the movie on a Criterion DVD, though Pablo Picasso gets credited for the appearance of a juggler’s costume.\\n\\n\\nReview shorts from my books\\n2,932 views\\n0 comments\\nPost not marked as liked\\nRecent Posts\\nSee All\\nThe Last Metro in Paris\\n7\\n0\\nPost not marked as liked\\nScenic Scandinavia on screen\\n19\\n0\\nPost not marked as liked\\nAround the World in 80+ movies--A Birder's Guide to Everything in Costa Rica\\n31\\n0\\nPost not marked as liked\\n© 2019 by Robin Holabird\"}, {'ReviewID': 22, 'Critic': 'Skip to main content\\nSearch\\nPapers\\nClippings\\nTopics\\nFree Trial\\nSign in\\nFreeview\\nEnjoy this clipping for free\\nTry 7 Days Free to get access to 979 million+ pages\\nTry 7 Days Free\\nThe Godfather*\\nSave to Ancestry\\nShare\\nView Newspaper\\nSearch the largest online newspaper archive\\nEvening Standard\\nLondon, Greater London, England • \\nThu, Aug 24, 1972\\nPage 22\\nCLIPPED BY\\nRotten_Tomatoes • May 26, 2021\\nEdited • May 27, 2021\\nSearch the largest online newspaper archive\\nTopics to Browse\\nS2 Ep7: Bradford Highwaymen Turned Convicts and a Robbery by a One-Armed Woman\\nOperation Barbarossa\\nIda B.

that the family spills in defence of its unity in the protection of its power to lay down the larw the Mafia law in American society Often the two go rivefflngly together with a vividness that conveys an unforgettable sense of shock The film begins and ends with two holy rituals — a wedding and a baptism — that are interleaved with violence And this conflict between the sacred and the profane runs

sun- court and agrees to perform acts of vengeance for supplicant fellow-Italians who find the American law offers them no redress for the private wrongs done their honour or their businesses Thus the film drives home the first of its cynical truths: that in this day and age when the machinery of the Law often delays Justice it is attractive to turn to an organisation like the Mafia which metes out revenge — a “kind of wild justice” as Bacon called it — in return for total obedience And at the end of the film Michael the new “Godfather” attends the christening of his \"godson” while his henchmen move out among the members of a rival Mafia gang and slay (hem in one of the most chilling blood-baths shown on the cinema screen The vow to renounce Satan alternates crudely but stunningly with the delivery of an enemy’s soul to its Maker by the quick pressure of a trigger finger This sense of ritual is what permeates The Godfather and gives a sense of dynastic structure to the plot a feeling of epic continuance to what could hare been Just a random series of gangster atrocities Running nearly three hours without an interval it sets down roots in society It shows organised crime to be the passport to the American Dream which the immigrant Sicilian ” Godfather ” wrote out for himself In one central sequence when son Michael has to flee to Sicily to escape a gang vendetta— an Immigrant In reverse— the film sums up vividly through his courtship of an Italian girl the code of honour revenge and instant justice which was carried on the emigrant boats to America Only a film as long and

Yes I suppose it is heightened even glamorised — the police harassment of the Mafia Is conspicuously absent in the film whereas in real life the Mafia chiefs live lives of constraint and watchfulness Volcano Even though you must be tired of reading about Brando’s triumph as the Godfather how the king has regained his throne it really is that — an extraordinary performance He’s introduced in the first shot with his back to us Gradually the circling camera reveals a transplanted volcano —a volcano that’s grown cold over the years but one that retains its brooding power The eyes are nearly

I’m only discussing the first two here because of their proximity to one another and them embodying a 70’s theme and aesthetic that prided on American stories – Five Easy Pieces, Nashville, Patton, Breaking Away, Dog Day Afternoon, and Rocky to name a few – make them distinctly different for what I want to say than the third movie, which seems like a forgotten stepchild of the 90’s. \\nWhat has become a set of iconic scenes that are impossible to parse from the indelible effect they have had on cinema through the ages, The Godfather is at its heart an epic fantasy. Not in the literal genre sense obviously, but in that it indulges itself and us in a magnanimous, exaggerated story of generational angst, wealth, and power. It has the structure of a medieval tale of kings and princes, and the heart of a valorous Biblical journey of self-realization and yes, destiny of a chosen son.\\nIt’s tinged in sepia colored dust and highlighted by shadows indicating that it’s not only a dark tale, but an old one. The movie consists of all the things that have become clichés in such type of cinema – a father and son relationship, battered women, family above everything, gambling, cops, gang wars, meetings in Italian restaurants – and creates a fully formed world so secluded from world from the rest of America that it may as well not even really exist. The intimate camerawork, highlighted by closeups and staging actors as if in a void, creates a sinister edge to every scene. The result is emphasizing that the world this film depicts is one where no one safe and every decision has high stakes. \\nMarlon Brando’s immortal performance as Don Vito Corleone has become such a mythical element to the film that to evaluate it in any way is impossible. It’s cloaked in decades of imitation and iconography that make it inseparable from our collective understanding of what a mafia person looks, acts, and thinks like. In the same way, Al Pacino’s equally valorized but perhaps more plain-looking Michael has become the idol of many young men with an irrationally proud sense of self, and, on the other side, the poster-child of everything wrong with toxic masculinity. Both Michael and Vito are perfect fantasy characters, the idealistic versions of what an average American man may consider the ideal version of himself – so perfectly represented by Tony Soprano’s self-assessment as the “the strong silent type.”\\nIt has the structure of a medieval tale of kings and princes, and the heart of a valorous Biblical journey of self-realization and yes, destiny of a chosen son.\\nIt’s impossible to be anybody from The Godfather, except perhaps Fredo (John Cazale), who embodies such open fear of inadequacy that it renders him the most relatable character in the series on any realistic human level. It’s also nearly impossible to consider the movie any pure condemnation or valorization of the mafia because it exists self-contained in the world completely apart from a greater American experience. It is filled with blood and death and suffering and some sense of politics, but unlike Lucky Luciano, a film which Normal Mailer called the actual “greatest mafia movie every made,” it doesn’t wade into the mafia’s actual greatest achievement – ingratiating itself with the American state apparatus. In this sense, it’s better to consider Coppola’s films as a mafia Game of Thrones. This is not a condemnation, in fact, it’s what makes the Godfather movies so timeless as rewatchable epics.\\nThis ideal is achieved perfectly in The Godfather: Part II, which to me is the best of the series. \\nCoppola was given much more creative control from the studio for this film, and it did wonders. His decision to do a simultaneous sequel-prequel, thus juxtaposing the father, Vito, as a young upstart who makes his way to wealth and power and the son, Michael, who is losing his grip on it and lamenting the burden he has taken may be Coppola’s greatest achievement as a filmmaker and storyteller. The same visual elements exist from the previous film, however the compositions are more wide-angled, and there is a lot more space to the scenes. Coppola is clearly more enamored with world-building than the previous movie. \\nThe Godfather II (Paramount Pictures)\\nThe sequence where Vito, Clemenza, and Tessio, who would grow up to be top members of the family, discuss the plot to kill Don Fannuci over glistening plates of spaghetti Bolognese, is perhaps American cinema at its peak. Spoken almost completely in Sicilian dialect, the scene is a masterclass of character development, setting up the early dynamic between the trio, which we had already seen the fruits of in The Godfather. Robert DeNiro is particularly great in this scene, and his command of tone and nailing the personality details of a young Vito overcomes his discomfort with an authentic Sicilian accent. Bruno Kirby is also fantastic – fast-talking and shoveling pasta with glee and poise throughout the whole proceeding, despite the terrifying prospect of killing one of the neighborhoods most feared and respected bosses. It’s clear how and why he became Vito’s most trusted arm later in time.\\nPart II justifies its greater budget and more broad scope in a way that most sequels don’t. Necessary to the expansion of the Corleone ‘empire’ under Michael and his insatiable need to rise and grasp more power, we are brought into more decorated and complex worlds. In turn, the flashback sequences perfectly exemplify what the first film had missed, which is a sense of connection and confrontation of the immigrant experience in America, although it only briefly remarks on this. Vito quickly ingratiates into his own crew and becomes more secluded in his existence. We also get more Fredo to the benefit of the story, as his demise and crisis in the film is the closest this trilogy comes to revealing the darker humanistic elements of their vaulted characters. John Cazale is impeccable and heartbreaking in a sequence where he slouches in his chair emptying his heart of the buried troubles of most men in America who fear their own inadequacy – “I can handle things, I’m smart! Not like everybody says!” he screams. \\nThe Godfather trilogy, and particularly its first two films, are iconic and ingratiated in the American cultural discussions of cinema and art so deeply that they’re hard to parse from their legendary status. They’re timeless epics that serve the viewer and the cinema-lover better as tall tales of kings, not as any introspective look at America or the ‘immigrant experience.’ From an artistic standpoint, their place in cinema is unquestioned in terms of its indelible effect on culture. One can gather that if the apex of Hollywood studio filmmaking in all its capitalist limitations, can be capped at using the visual tools of cinema at the service of a story, I can’t think of many movies that do it better than The Godfather. \\nThe Godfather II Trailer:\\nFollow The Spool\\nWe're on Twitter/X here.\\nRead: the best live TV streaming services with free trial>\\nThe Spool:

Reissue. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola. At Astor Plaza.\\nRunning time: 175 mins. Rated: R. FROM ITS OPULENT opening wedding sequence to the climactic baptism of blood, \"The Godfather\" still grips an audience 25 years after its initial release. The saga of Don Vito Cor-leone, head of a powerful 1940s New York mob family, remains as compelling as it was in 1972, when little-known director Francis Ford Coppola turned Mario Puzo\\'s novel into a movie masterpiece. As opposed to the recently rereleased \"Star Wars\" trilogy, which has had a major renovation, \"The Godfather\" returns to theaters with only its soundtrack digitally remastered from mono to stereo.\\nCoppola\\'s vision of a twisted American Dream returns to the big screen virtually intact and filmgoers again can revel in all-too-familiar scenes the bloody horse\\'s head; the eye-popping execution of assassin Luca Brasi; the machine gun massacre of Sonny Cor-leone, and the unforgettable finale, when Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) \"takes care of all family business\" - ahem - again : in a blood-spattered de- ,\\',t nouement intercut with the religious solemnity of his godson\\'s baptism.. But \"The Godfather\" isn\\'t merely a violent tale about : r an underworld inhabited by bloodthirsty mobsters. Its story is mainly about family ties, blood and honor. \"The Godfather\\'s\" status as a film classic was forged by career-making performances from Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, Pacino as youngest son Michael, Robert Duvall as adopted brother Tom Hagen and James Caan as the impulsive, doomed Sonny. Despite Brando\\'s limited screen time, his presence overpowers the film.\\nYet it\\'s Pacino\\'s performance, as the idealistic war hero . turned ruthless crime lord -that takes on new meaning the second time around. To compare the role of Michael Corleone to Pacino\\'s poignant portrayal of real-life- mobster as middle-aged los- er in the new Donnie Braseo\" is to see a great carreer come full circle. .

Rated R. I\\'.ven the critic whose stock-in-trade is evaluation, as opposed, to prediction, has got to cut iJo.se on the subject of \"The Godfather\" out of sheer excitement: This is going to be not only the most widely seen, but also the most widely honored movie of 1972. For a change, the general public and t h e list-makers and the award-givers are going to be able to say, as if in one voice, \"Now, that\\'s what I call a movie!\" Like the Mario Puzo saga that inspired it, Francis Ford Coppola\\'s screen version of \"The Godfather\" has an almost hypnotic effect. One is immediately and irrevocably caui;1 1 up in the drama.\\nIts momentum simply doesn\\'t permit awareness of turning X-number of pages or sitting for X-number of minutes. At just under three hours, the movie is nearly twice as long as other feature films but one doesn\\'t even notice that there was no intermission until its all over. Whv? The spellbinding effect of \"T h e Godfather\" can be (raced to (he work\\'s unusual point of view, to the clarity and terseness of Coppola\\'s adaptation, and to Marlon Krandn\\'s perfectly stunning characterization of Don Vito Corleone, the Mafia chieftain whose life and times the work chronicles. Set in the \\'40s, something of a transition period for under-world figcres, \"The Godfather\" examines the rackets and the people who run them by z:-roing in on one family. The word family applies not only to his relatives, but also to b i s business associates.\\nThai particular concept of family is, in fact, the work\\'s key concept. More than\\' merely a pater familias, the Godfather is also a kind of Pope, a person who speaks ex cathedra, who dispenses justice and wisdom, who rewards good and punishes evil. Throughout the work, one recognizes this aspect of the Godfather\\'s character even as one recognizes just as certainly that he is an outlaw, a murderer, the thug at the top of the pecking order. Seeing the Godfather from a dual perspective creates ambivalence in the viewer, sets up a tension between two simultaneous points of view that rivet one\\'s attention to the proceedings. Unlike routine gangland exposes and here\\'s where the conventional moralists get rouled up.\\n\"The Godfather\" doesn\\'t point fingers at good guys and bad guys. Instead, it forces one to consider (he possibility that a man who orders murder like some people order toast can also enjoy gardening. It puts forth the hypothesis that man is neither all good or al\\' bad but, perversely, something ot both. The hypothesis, like several others raised bv \"The God Y ,y. 1 .\\n1 Susan Stark\\'s Best Movies \\'A father,\" is worth thinking about, but the main business of the picture clearly isn\\'t to make one think so much as to keep one. engrossed in the winding narrative. The story of the New York-based Don\\'s struggle to retain control of his empire during the era when drugs became known in underworld circles as \"t h e coming thing\" moves from the Sicilian hills to the Las Vegas casinos, embracing enough characters along the way to populate a Busby Berkeley spectacular. IT IS TO COPPOLA\\'S great credit, as both director and screenwriter, that the film at no point provokes bewilderment about who did what and why and where. All the characters are defined by their relationship to the Godfather, at the outset, which provides the viewer w i t h a manageable point of reference, and the narraiive itself is blessed with transitions that are both coherent and graceful.\\nOt notices another Coppola touch, equally appreciated but quite unexpected. The film punctuates its most grim sequences with humor. Just before we must watch a Hollywood bigshot who has been \"disrespectful\" to the Godfather pay for his disrespect in an incredibly gruesome way, Coppola gives us a laugh by comparing the polite, dignified approach of the mobster\\'s emissary with the no-nonsense vulgarity of the movie man\\'s manner. By midfilm, an oft-recurring line used to describe the family\\'s way of doing business \"We\\'ll make them an offer they can\\'t refuse\" also becomes a source of comic relief. The steadiness and imagination Coppola brings to the film would be cause for commendation under any circumstances.\\nCiiven the non-stop midwife activities of the Paramount brass from the second they acquired rights to Puzo\\'s novel, however, Coppola should be considered for the Medal of Honor-That being duly noted, one Masonic Auditorium NETHERLANDS COMfAHX Of 99 \"A gem of a company\" Cliv lam, N.Y.

Brando has come homt. Brando\\'s highly personal some would say quirky style serves him in thjs performance, as it has served him in all his other great roles. He is able, because of some magic interaction between body and voice, to pro ject all the paradoxes upon which human nature is founded. He is brutal and tender, beautiful and ugly, strong and weak, inviolate and vulnerable, repellent and ar pealing.\\nGiven \"The Godfather\\'s\" hypothesis about the nature of man, he incorporates, within the confines of his character, the film\\'s entire narra-t i v e. His character is th film\\'s point. Fven if that were not true, one would line it literally im possible to notice anyone else when Brando\\'s on screen. It is no accidem that one becomes aware of all the other first-rate actors in the film, even those in relatively big role like Al Pacino and Janif g Caan, only when they\\'re working alongside someone other than Brando. It\\'s mot that Brando is flamboyant or in any other way professionally selfish.\\nMaybe it\\'s just tha opposite. Maybf) the secret of Brando\\'s power is that he, like maybe a handful of others, vnderstands fully what stillness and repose and tent-\\'.tiveness mean in terms of impa\\'-t on film. Attempting to analyze Brando\\'s work, in terms of components, must inevitably diminish it. though. See the way he creates Don Corleone\\'s death scene and attempt to define the perceptions he brings to the scene as written by Puzo.\\nSuffice it to say that when Brando\\'s on screen, \"The Godfather\" rises above the occasion, becomes more than engrossing entertainment, becomes art.

Ruddy film based on Puzo novel. , MOVIE REVIEW \\'Godfather\\': The Gangster Film Moves Uptown BY CHARLES CHAMPLIN - The most revealing thing I can tell you about \"The Godfather\" is that it cost $6 million and has already brought in more than twice that $13 million in advance payments from exhibitors eager to play what they\\'re betting will be -a walloping great hit. And they\\'re absolutely, 100 right, , as local audiences will start proving on Wednesday at the Village in Westwood and at Loew\\'s Holly vood..\\nMario Puzo\\'s novel, was an irresistible, eventful, easy-to-digest, Jiard-to-put-down best seller (a half-million\\' hardbacks, 10 million paperbacks) and. Puzo and director Francis Ford Coppola, who coauthored the script, have delivered the novel just about as faithfully as a novel can be delivered. You liked the side action upstairs in the bedroom during the wedding? You . got it. Liked the horse-head bit? You ; got it.\\nThe restaurant caper with the crooked police captain? You got it, you got it. A slam-bang novel with boundless energy and the spicy suggestion that\\' all sorts of secrets are being told under thin disguises has become a rousing movie (a MOVIE-movie, as they say) which seems to me to succeed perfectly at what it set out to do. It is marvelously well cast and acted. It evokes a fairly nondescript period in American life the mid to late 40s with unerring fidelity and interest. It is swift and theatrical, probably the fastest three-hour movie in history.\\nIt is incessantly - and explicitly violent, but saves on emotional wear and tear by having the bad guys kill off the. bad guys, so that what\\'s to care? .. As I remember the only innocent who gets it is the nice Sicilian wife who goes to pieces in the car, but that only sets you up for the massive counterblows back home. And at that, the whole extravagant operation is so Little Cae-sarean that to respond to it anywhere near the threshold of pain is like reading Harold Robbins for symbols.

J. FLEMING Movl Rivliwir It is a rare day when a major motion picture opens in the Orlando area almost simultaneously with its New York premiere. Instead of waiting several months to see the much-heralded film of \"The Godfather,\" we now have an opportunity to see what all the talk is about. It opened last week at Seminole Cinema.\\nAs it happens, the film is so superlative that it would have been worth waiting for. , The controversy over the movie started as soon as Mario Puzo\\'s best-selling novel began to be transformed into a screenplay. Arguments over the use of the word \"Mafia\" (which doesn\\'t appear in the script though \"wop,\" \"dago,\" and other ethnic epithets do), over who would direct the picture (young Francis Ford Coppola, an Italian-American like many in the large cast, was wisely chosen) and over who would play the title role gave the gossip columnists much material over the past months. WITH REGARD TO THE latter issue, the choice of Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone is brilliant. It is his first outstanding performance in many years.\\nPaunchy, husky-voiced and arrogant, he conveys the believable combination of toughness and warmth which makes the film itself so memorable. The picture is as much about family loyalty as anything else, and Brando, at the aging patriarch, embodies this concern with familial codes. Brando, 47, plays a man in his late sixties with such force that his presence dominates the film even though he appears only in selected scenes. More central to the complex plot is Michael, one of the Don\\'s younger sons; as played by Al Pacino. He is even more memorable than Brando.\\nMichael\\'s transformation, implausible though it is, from an innocent youth, fresh from the Ivy League, to a cool, ruthless heir to his father\\'s changing domain is made convincing by Paclno\\'s performance. AFTER HAVING HIS jaw broken by a corrupt policeman, Michael kills the cop and a rival family leader. Thus initiated into crime, he heads for a lengthy stay in Sicily, where he is married, only to have his bride blown up in his car. While abroad he learns that his hot-tempered older brother Sonny (James Caan) has been gunned down. He returns to the U.\\nS., shifts the family\\'s \"business\" to Las Vegas and marries his former sweetheart. Thus the Corleones, isolated from normalcy, move toward social respectability. Director Coppola subtly moves from scenes of brutality to family meals and conclaves so that this absorbing look into an almost legendary subculture becomes a wholly credible, 10-year chronicle of a humanly real family. Nostalgia Enjoys Finest Hour On Film By NOEL HOLSTON Sentinel staff Of the many films made recently in a nostalgic vein, \"The Last Picture Show,\" is the most evocative, candid and realistic attempt yet made to portray the attitudes and desires of people a decade or more ago. But to truly appreciate director Peter Bogdanovich\\'s brilliant black-and-white you have the freedom to curse without fear of reprisal or offering you a cigarette when no one was around to tell.\\nThere was smooching at the downtown picture show, parking in the family car, sneaking into smokey pool halls where the old fellows spread dominoes on chalky tables, rushing to football games where the whole town turned out, sipping cheap liquor from paper cups behind the to the lure of television and football, further accentuates the slowing pulse of the community. THE DEATH OF Sam the Lion and later, his retarded son, enlarge upon the air of complacency and boredom strangling the area. The simple fixture of love and entertainment people are dying. The people are that constitute life for the towns-out of step with life and too too too callow to does obscene language and nudity. But whether for its honesty and careful blend of pathos and humor or the virtuoso performances of Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges, Cloris Leachman, Ellen Burstyn, and especially Ben Johnson, \"The Last Picture Show\" is not an offensive motion picture.\\nIt is a powerful and moving portrait of a town and a time. There are moments of joy in this The technique of Ironic Juxtaposition becomes ludicrous, however, near the end as Michael, acting as godfather to his nephew, promises the priest that he will \"renounce Satan and all his works\" while we watch Corleone enemies being slaughtered with savage intensity. That afternoon, Michael will have the baby\\'s father killed because the family\\'s honor must be protected. IS THERE A moral to this \"Gone With the Wind,\" -Italian-style? The family that kills together stays together? Mafiosi are just like everyone else? \\' \" Brando himself was quoted in a recent Newsweek cover story as saying that \"The Godfather\" is not really about the Mafia but about the American corporate mind. Well, the film does glamorize gangland violence and sentimentalize the underworld by ignoring both the cynicism of the heroes and the nature of their victims.\\nThe Corleones are good-looking and their enemies ugly. The old Don dies while playing with his three-year-old grandson. Yet we must remember that Puzo\\'s novel and screenplay, despite the realistic local color (and some Italian dialogue) makes no pretense to be serious history or accurate sociology. BOTH BOOK AND movie indicate the immense entertainment potential which the Mafia has represented since television\\'s \"The Untouchables.\" Its members are more secretive, mysterious and powerful than figures from the old West, and they are considerably more violent than the most ruthless cowboy villain. \"The Godfather\" displays murder by bombing, strangling, stabbing and, of course, machine gunning.\\nBlood, it seems, can be a profitable business. One can imagine, a host of sequels spawned by this sure-fire box office hit. When you tire of the Godfather game, which has been selling briskly for some months, you can probably look forward to \"Son of the Godfather,\" \"The Godson,\" \"Daughter of the Godfather Meets the Godson,\" etc., etc. It\\'s promising enough to make a thug put down his gun and pick up a pen. But the effective mingling of innocence and corruption here raises this moving, adult film above the level of the ordinary gangland thriller.\\nIts three hours of well-acted, well-written and fascinating drama constitute an original and intriguing film achievement..\\nUnited States\\nFlorida\\nOrlando\\nThe Orlando Sentinel\\n1972\\nMar\\n26\\nPage 151\\nThe Godfather*\\nSubscribe\\nGift Subscriptions\\nHelp\\nSite Map\\nAbout\\nFish Wrap—Official Blog\\nAffiliates\\nContent Providers\\nUnited States (English)\\nVisit our other sites\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nInstagram\\n© 2024 Newspapers.com™ by Ancestry®.

OLIVER PRESCOTT Times Drama Critic The well-groomed, expensively dressed men sit around their executive table sipping wine and discussing the advantages and possible dangers of adding the sale and traffic of heroin to their list of rackets.\\nFinally the overwhelming advantages persuade them to accept the idea without fear of interference by the politicians and police who sanction their gambling and prostitution crimes because they are acceptable, money-making diversions. \"AFTER ALL, we\\'re not Communists,\" quips their leader. This scene which appears well into the plot of the film, \"The Godfather,\" based on Mario Puzo\\'s best-selling novel and now playing at Loew\\'s, St. Petersburg, is a key to the tone of this 1940s gangster-melodrama. The Mafia (though the word is never mentioned in the Marlon Brando (left) and former world champion wrestler Lenny Montana look on at the wedding of the Godfathers daughter.\\nMOVIE REVIEW movie, the allusions to this secret society are inescapably clear) was well on its way toward becoming a highly organized, financially powerful segment of our society its leaders not only acceptable, but respectable. Throughout the film we observe these men and their families. It\\'s almost a shame to call them racketeers because so often they appear warm and human. They live in posh suburban palaces, but they deal and work in the slums. They are easy with their affections for one another, and equally as easy with their temper and violence.\\nPuzo\\'s novel involves us with their lives, their social amenities, their murders and their personal conflicts and complexities. THE FILM does all of this and more. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, one of the writer-collaborators for \"Patton\" and coauthor with Mario, Puzo of this screenplay, \"The Godfather\" brings a rich visual texture to the story. Along with Marlon Brando\\'s beautifully understated performance as the aging Don Corleone and Al Pacino\\' sensitive portrayal of his son, this visual realization of Puzo\\'s characters gives them considerably more depth than did the novel. Whatever may be said of the literary skills displayed in the book, it is without doubt a superb piece of storytelling.\\nIt\\'s an exceptionally good comeback for Brando, who\\'s never really been that far away, in a movie that is now tender, now shockingly violent and often pleasing to the eye. But mainly, \"The Godfather\" is a good story that makes at least some of the members of the Mafia almost lovable. Loew\\'s, 3150 Fifth Avenue N, \"The Godfather,\" screenplay by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, based on the novel by Mario Puio, directed by Francis Ford Coppola.

Ji - \"The Godfather,\" which opened yes-j trrrlay at the Warner at the rxtraordi-1 nary hour of 9 a. in , may seem to have j little in common with Erich Segal\\'s brief book.\\nJ But, luckily for Paramount, the films ! dn share at least two qualities: They are j both based on books that almost every- body read, and t liny are both films which manage to be remarkable screen equiva-i lents of the books which inspired them. That\\'s lhe key to com men ial success In both cases, I belies e. \"The Godfather\" is probably the most fcant-to-soc movie of the year for the public, so young director-writer Francis Ford Coppola has tackled an exceptionally difficult job in translating Mario Puzo\\'s hefty tome into film terms. lie has succeeded in doing so with a fidelity beyond what we reasonably could expect. 1 \"Jut .\\nmore important, he has made a fine lihn which lives on its own terms, which succeeds as stirring cinema, and which occasionally conveys something more than just superlical entertainment. AS EVERYONE surely must know, the story of \"The Godfather\" concerns the life of a Mafia family from the mid-10\\'s to the niid-70s, concentrating particularly on a prolonged gang war between rival families. The screenplay by Coppola and Puzo concentrates on the decline of the rider Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) and the ascension of his son Michael (Al Pacino). \\'The. Godfather9 Opens at the Warner Much of the movie, therefore, has a brooding autumnal quality which may surprise audiences in the light of the murh-puhlirizcd violence of the story, Coppola has emphasized this melancholy portrait of the aging Don by using a strangely weathered color scheme which makes the movie look like a product of the period it portrays.\\nIn this respect, he does in a big commercial Technicolor movie what Peter Bogdano-vich did in a small black-and-white film, \"The Last Picture Show.\" Rrando\\'s performance, a low-keyed but intense portrayal of a man who seems to be dying from the first moment we see him, is an interesting bit of characterization. Because none of Brando\\'s performances over the last 10 years was as bad as many reviews said they were, I\\'m not surprised that this one isn\\'t as great as its advance notice. There was little surprise for me, also, in Al Pacino\\'s strong performance as Michael, the college boy and war hero who becomes the ruthless rackets boss. I thought Pacino was brilliant in last year\\'s underrated \"Panie in Needle Park,\" and he merely reinforces that impression here. AS FOR the violence, it is imaginatively staged, wholly appropriate and remarkably convincing.\\nCoppola manages to make each gangland slaying distinctive and cleverly arranged, so that the film\\'s many lawless executions become more than just a parade of similar homicides. Much of the film\\'s underlying substance goes unstated, but it is all there, through a wealth of detail. The cultural and Tamilian tradition, the passionate sense of honor, the never-questioned contradictions that unite to form the Mafia code are all present, if not articulated. Coppola has also been highly successful in re-creating the period of his film. The clothes, the cars, the billboards, the thousand little items which contribute to an overall visual impact are without detectable flaw.\\nTHE ENORMOUS cast of characters has been pared to manageable propor tions, while still retaining the sense of epic swirl in a story that seems to span generations. For example, the much discussed character of singer Johnny Fontane (Al Martino) appears in only two scenes, but he\\'s a peripheral figure at best. The general level of performance, however, is excellent. James Caan as the hot-bloodied Sonny, Robert Duvall as the omnipresent counsel, Richard Castellano as the cold-blooded yet ironically likeable killer Clcmcna are especially good. Commendable in cameos are Sterling Hayden as a crooked police captain, John Marley as the studio head, and Morgana King as Mrs.\\nCorleone. But, the whole look and demeanor of the cast from principal to walk-on is perfect. Nino Rota has created a fine, sentimental score which sounds like it came from an early Fellini film. \"The Godfather\" is, of course, not a great film. It was not a great book.\\nBut, it is a good, satisfying, entertainment with some sequences that rise above even this admirable level. painstakingly revealed by Coppola.\\nUnited States\\nPennsylvania\\nPittsburgh\\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette\\n1972\\nMar\\n23\\nPage 14\\nThe Godfather*\\nSubscribe\\nGift Subscriptions\\nHelp\\nSite Map\\nAbout\\nFish Wrap—Official Blog\\nAffiliates\\nContent Providers\\nUnited States (English)\\nVisit our other sites\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nInstagram\\n© 2024 Newspapers.com™ by Ancestry®.

COLLINS Inquirer Entertainment Writer \"That schlock classic, \"The Godfather,\" has been turned into an almost flawless gangster movie, a movie that proves they can still make movies the way they used to. It opened Wednesday at the Fox. Practically everything has been done right in this version of Mario Puzo\\'s best-selling novel about the Mafia. The picture hews to a strong narrative line that keeps an audience looking forward eagerly to what will happen next.\\nParamount Pictures and Director Francis Ford Coppola have paid us the compliment of casting the picture for talent rather than marquee names, the only exception being Marlon Brando, whose popularity should now recover lost ground. THE PICTURE is really Coppola\\'s triumph. He collaborated on the screenplay with Puzo and worked the whole thing out with an unobtrusive mastery which is capable of subtlety while refusing to be lured into arty byways. Puzo\\'s novel was one of those pieces of pseudo-literature which we read not for what it told us about ourselves but for information. Puzo seemed to have the inside dope on the Mafia and its \"families,\" details that not \\'Medipet\\' Sought In California SACRAMENTO, Calif.\\n(AP). If it costs more to give medical care to pets than to children, shouldn\\'t there be some sort of medipet? Carlos Bee of Hayward, Democratic speaker pro tempore of the California Assembly, thinks maybe there should. So he has introduced a bill into the Assembly that would make veterinarian bills deductible from state income tax, as are medical bills. -C .-f j.-is v,-.- Aj. -\" .\\nAl Pacino and Marlon Brando They\\'re soji and father in \\'The Godfather\\' even the United States Senate has been able to unearth. It was fascinating stuff, and it is somehow even more fascinating on the screen, although the word, \"Mafia,\" is never spoken in the movie, out of respect for Italian-American sensibilities. The omission can only be regarded as an instance of industry hypocrisy, since to much of the movie\\'s appeal lies in the juxtaposition of Italian-American domestic life the spaghetti and scallopini and the beloved bambini with the cold-blooded gangland killings in which all these warm, friendly fathers and sons are engaged.

My hat is off to Francis Ford Coppola, whose direction is as unfailingly triumphant as his remarkably efficient screenplay, which he wrote with Mario Puzo, author of the best seller. , I would not have believed that a powerfully impressive film could emerge from Puzo\\'s rubbishy novel a racy potboiler in which raunchy sex and raw violence wash away any interest it has as an exotic account of the inner workings of the Mafia. Unlike the millions of readers who were reportedly transfixed, I was able to put the book down without much . trouble.\\nThe movie, however, completely held my attention with its wide sweep and epic grandeur. No wonder they are calling it the \"Gone With the Wind\" of gangster films. The straightforward, rapidly paced narrative an emotion-charged melodrama of family loyalty intermingled with assassinations and massacres is faithful to the novel, but with an integrity of purpose that cuts through most of the sensationalism. Coppola has brought strength, depth and excitement to the film, which grips the viewer with the incongruous events centering on the close-knit Corteone clan Sicilian-Americans who hold to a rigid code of family duty, honor and respect, while the men are involved in the bloody business of Mafia killings, extortion and racketeering. Set back in the post-World War II period (1945-51), the story is about the ultimately corrupted American Dream, where business is \"strictly business\" even if it\\'s crime and murder and family life is sacred.\\nDon Vito Corleone is the Godfather, who heads the dy-n a s t y. Marlon Brando\\'s much-acclaimed portrayal of the deceptively courtly, grandfatherly crime czar is astonishing for the actor\\'s magnetic control, but it\\'s not as convincing as it should be. \\' Brando\\'s sixtyish makeup particularly the padded jowls gives him a Cro-Magnon look. And his gentle, mumbling voice al- \"THE GODFATHER,\" Paramount Picture; produced by Albert S.

And Pacino (whose only other film was \"Panic in Needle Park\") is magnificently effective as the younge.it, Michael a withdrawn Dartmouth graduate who eventually inherits the Godfather\\'s domain after a change of heart brings him into the family\\'s ruthless business. There\\'s been no more fascinating depiction of the Italian-run organization and its curious aura of intramural respectability since \"The Sicilian Clan.\" \"The Godfather\" is a big-, ger, more vivid movie that seems to overwhelm us with violence and gore (garrot-ings, shootings, knifings, a bullet right through the eye, even a severed horse\\'s head). But I saw no attempt to Delayed a Dav \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" will open at the Orpheum Theater on Tuesday, March 28, instead of March 27, as construction of the stage and set will take another day. ?riT\\'i xggS glorify the killers and the gang warfare makes it frightemngly clear that crime is a treacherous and deadly occupation.\\nCoppola assembled the film with brilliant ingenuity. The period settings of New York, Hollywood, Las Vegas and Sicily are rich in period and ethnic details, especially the opening sequence of an Italian wedding held at the don\\'s 50-acre, flashily bourgeois estate on Long Island.

superfluous One is the film that offers so little to divert that the less said about it the better The other kind has so much of what makes films sc universally appealing as entertainment that one wants merely to say “Just go see for yourself’ or some such nebulous thing To talk about it further js to risk diluting the impact \"The Godfather\" the already celebrated film from Mario Puzo’s novel On The Aisle about the feudal world of the Mafia is one such movie Others that come readily to mind are “Romeo and Juliet” the Russian “War and Peace\" and another film starring Marlon Brando “On the Waterfront” Of those the viewer that when he is set free to stumble forth it is the everyday surroundings which seem foreign SOME THINGS about “The Godfather” are common knowledge among them is that it was what is termed a runaway best seller worth about half a million copies hi hardcov-\" er and 10 million in paperback To be so successful of course a book could only be what some critcs sniffed at as “trashy sensationalism\" The subject matter of “The Godfather\" deals with the under world syndicate’s power structure political intrigues and corruption More deliciously It also revealed to us the private Mafioso his Italian love and loyalty to family and associates the primitive sense of honor and principle that colors everything about him and even somehow transcends his bust ness way of life — murder and thievery ‘“The Godfather” covers all that depicting events over a few years following World War H in settings mostly in New York The film opens with Brando’s graying Don Corleone

are siphoned off by a gold strike THE KIDS range in age from about 9 to 15 with the smallest barely big enough to sit on a horse There are some nice sequences in which they learn about the hard knocks of cowboy life immediately auditioning on a glorious Italian wedding reception It is an event which at once symbolizes the wealth and respect a-bilty of the don (\"We have wires from senators and a governor expressing their regret ’’) while permitting us a peek at the murderous business which earned it WE WITNESS domestic squabbles and ecstasies and we eavesdrop on hard-nosed business negotiations about equitable division of judges and drug profits And we are privy to a violent and bloody change from the regime of the don with his courtly mien to that of his son Al Pacino a newcomer to films portrays him as the new young breed of professional Mafioso war hero and college educated but cold and remote and even more dangerous because of the legitimate facade Certainly there is gore retribution in the underworld is shown as swift and abrupt and nearly always a surprise Sometimes it is by garrotting once in\\' a \"Bonnie and Clyde” hail of machine-gun bullets But killing is nothing personal just the business way and the implication is that it is no more brutal than ordinary capitalistic business practices Al ways the violence is juxtaposed with gentle everyday ritual the incongruity of it is shocking and unfailingly ironic COWRITERS PUZO and Francis Ford Coppola and Coppola as director have given the movie a straightforward narrative approach Their production has been assembled with such attention to detail such skillful interweaving of quiet and violence of glamour and domesticity that one never really notices the three-hour length of \"The Godfather” In the premiere showing the impression of immersing oneself in a novel was the greater for the lack of intermission interruption Typical of Coppola\\'s sense of feeling is the way he differentiates between the dark side of the Mafioso conducting underworld business in darkened surroundings and his “legitimate” side in which things like purity and honor are equated with glaring sunlight TOO THE YOUNG Mafioso groom might be expected to display his affluence by presenting his bride with a huge diamond instead the simplicity of his regard is symbolised in a plain band Atmospheric detail is heightr ened by another evocative score from Nino Rota of \"Romeo and Juliet” and \"La Dolce Vita” fame Yes but what about the acting? Brando as everybody says is excellent as Corleone with his squat paunchy bulk his Cro-magnon profile aid his breathy rasping voice But then we\\'ve always found Brando impressive even in his second- and third-rate efforts BUT ONE OF the beauties of the film is the balanced characterizations Supercool Al Pacino is likewise chillingly believable and so are several oth er gangsters most of them actors whose names are unfamiliar Only two examples of less than inspired casting come to mind They are James Caan who acts splendidly as the hot-tempered Sonny but is rather too much the all-America boy to suit the Italian image and Pacino\\'s wife Diane Keaton Iter\\'s is a somewhat blank characterization and her WASP heritage makes her stick out like a sore thumb But the thought occurs that as the outsider looking in she may represent us IDURING EASTER WjEEKl VOSEMiTE HWY 41 wt’mm mt 1 Ml A BABY HAMA R DO THIS AND MUCH MQRE SAFARI (AienuD M Central Californla’sBM Kl!

Great Gangster Movie : In the first moments of \"The Godfather\" looking at Marlon Brando sitting there as Don Vito Corleone the elderly Mafia family chieftain you may be conscious of Marlon Brando You may be bemused by the change in his looks for instance: lower jaw thrust forward jowls drooping a slight curl in the lip below the mustache — not a sneer really just the : \"The Godfather\\'\\' directed by Francis Ford Coppola written by COPPOia and Mario Puzo from the tatters novel of the seme name with Marlon Brand° Al Pacino James Caan Richard Castellano Robert Duvall Sterling Hayden John Marley Richard Conte and Diane Keaton In color running time 178 minutes Century 22 R MV:rMin &amp;nwwii:mcwoomi result perhaps of years of unconscious disdain at people and things that are really beneath Don Corleone — and at the slow massive way he moves And the voice which also is deliberate and is an older man\\'s voice But these actor\\'s accoutrements are quickly gone from the mind and so is any consciousness of Marlon Bran-do I cannot say in the subsequent three hours the other day in the Century 22 Theater that I was ever again able to summon to mind Brando\\'s own image I did not really try very hard of course I was too completely caught up in the reality of the powerful magnetic presence of Don Corleone and the gradual change — aging softening a little the voice steadily rougher and higher the movement slower the edge of the will dulled a little the mind less decisive Ile is often not physically present but his dominance of the story is rarely unfelt Brando\\'s performance is magnificent These early moments in Francis Ford Coppola\\'s sure-handed gripping realization of Mario Puzo\\'s novel of the same name are also highly meaningful in other ways They help us to understand how the Mafia works and they establish the contrasts which are at the heart of what Coppola and Puzo seem to be driving at Outside in a garden washed with warm sunlight a boisterously merry Italian wedding is going on—dancing singing wine cookies smiles Inside blinds closed against the brightness Don Corleone is holding court in his study On his daughter\\'s wedding day he can refuse By William C Glackin no favors by custom His adopted son Tom Ilagen (a fine watchful wary sensitively human performance by Robert Duvall) who is the Family (Mafia Family that is) lawyer its official consighere or counselor handles the appointment list The man we are listening to as the movie opens is an undertaker ivhose daughter has been raped beaten and marred for life Ile is asking for vengeance on her attackers who have been let off by the court \"I believe in America\" he tells Don Corleone \"America made my fortune I went to the police like a good American\" But after the trial \"then I said to my wife \\'For justice we must go to Don Corleone \" Don Corleone gently but implacably rebukes the man for never before asking or offering friendship for not coming to him at the beginning of the case When the petitioner\\'s humiliation has been made clear he agrees to act but he tells Tom when the man has gone to assign the job to men who will not lose their heads: \"We are not murderers\" As the movie progresses the statement \\' becomes much more than merely ironic it represents a peculiar ability to view life in a special way The contrasts as they continue are tremendously effective: The light of family celebration the dark of Family business the gaiety of the wedding guests the ugliness of a photographer\\'s camera being smashed and an FBI card being spit on Outside young Michael Corleone still in his World War II uniform smiles at the\\' red-haired girl he has brought to the party He calmly explains how his father can \"persuade\" a band leader to let a singer out of a contract with a gun at his head but Michael can also believe that he is not going to enter the family \"business\" Part \\' of the business of the movie is to show that he cannot help doing so The drastic contrast of light and shade in these effective opening scenes is symbolic of A central idea of the movie: \\'the contrast be tween the ordinary and even likable humanity of

police gangsters (One thing the movie does not show and it is an important shortcoming in a story about the Maifa: the effect of its activity on ordinary victims as distinguished from rival gangsters) This is an exciting movie brilliantly well made It tells its story mainly through action but it never makes you feel too much is happening too fast Its story need not be recounted here except to gay that it traces the fluctuating fortunes of the Corleone Family as they battle with the other Mafia clans and decide eventually to take on the drug traffic too (The time is the late 1940s suggested by Coppola in a wealth of authentic detail) In the process the film also traces the transformation of Michael from a war hero whose hands are clean into the head of the Family As Michael Al Pacino should become the Dustin Hoffman of 1972 an immediate star Handsome likable a fine actor he manages with great restraint to suggest Michael\\'s intelligence his patience and self-control and the depth of his feeling for his father \"The Godfather\" is more than just a great gangster movie It suggests more realistically than the memorable films of the 1930s the frightening scope of the problem and more accurately and interestingly the nature of the enemy In the contrast between private kindness and public viciousness we not only find out that bad guys can love their mothers but are reminded that people who are genuinely admirable in some respects may also be not only murderers but a threat to us all Finally far from glorify- ing gangsterism the movie is a highly moral one Coppola comes down hard at the end in cross cutting that ironically alternates between a baptism in a church where Michael is acting as the godfather of his nephew Michael and the series of Mafia murders taking place around the city \"Michael\" the priest asks the baby \"Do you renounce Satan and all his works?\" You know the man who answers \"I do\" is already damned The two stars are supported by a host of fine

Service Rock\" is never quite good enough it is always pretty good — and inventive and attentive to reasonable detail It means to build its humor out of character more than situation — which is an honorable way of doing things I suppose and which works for at least some of its people — most notably for Paul Sand as a Jewish intellectual burglar who learned how to blow things up while behind the barricades at Berkeley and the Sorbonne But for the other characters characterization often gets in the way Both George Segal a master lock-picker whose every job is a crisis of confidence and Robert Redford whose nerves of steel enmesh a nervous stomach emerge less as people than as exceptionally intricate cliches This does well enough most of the time but ever so often it fails desperately — and usually while demonstrating that some adventure is supposed to be just a bit more than merely funny or merely suspenseful though it usually turns out to be just a bit less For the caper movie is a

The R-rated production opened yesterday at the Fox. In bringing Mario Puzo\\'s sprawling novel to the screen, director Francis Ford Coppola has miraculously avoided the obvious pitfalls concomitant with the filming of successful literary works. Sensationalism and gore--although a vital part of the -have been kept pretty much in tow. Rather, Coppola stresses atmosphere, characterization, sentiment and emotion--the stuff of which pure moviemovies are made.\\nThe Puzo novel has been wisely relegated to the background, providing an all-important foundation on which characters and situations are conceived and refined. What emerges is a broad-shouldered soap opera with the same gutsy atmosphere of yesteryear\\'s popular gangster flick. To convey Puzo\\'s fable of the all-powerful Corleone family, Coppola has assembled a peerless cast. As Don Corleone, the revered and feared family head, Marlon Brando delivers a thoroughly professional, wellthought-out portrayalwhich is mercifully free of his usual twitchy mannerisms. The great actor is in complete control of his creativity here, AL PACINO and DIANE KEATON visions of Bogart and Sheridan and the benefit and pleasure is all ours.\\nAbly abetting Brando as two of his sons are Al Pacino and James Caan. Both turn in memory-filled performances: Pacino\\'s quiet strength is reminiscent of Bogart, while Caan epitomizes Cagney with his cockiness and electric temper. For further memories, there\\'s leading lady Diane Keaton whose passive beauty generates visions of Ann Sheridan and Gladys George.

The violence in the film is quite valid and very detailed. Coppola, luckily, is a filmmaker who knows when to quit, and never needlessly prolongs the gore. Beyond its violence, the most frightening aspect of \"The Godfather\" is its sentimental manner of presenting the Corleones.\\nThey remain very likable people throughout even while slaughtering and destroying. At the screening I attended, the audience mistook them for heroes, and applauded and cheered their every victory. It was jolting. \"The Godfather\" runs a full-bodied 175 minutes, but fear not, you\\'ll be mesmerized for every one of those minutes.

Francis Ford Coppola, young director of the film (it\\'s only his fourth) and Puzo, who did the screenplay, have caught the essence of the appeal of the novel that of fascinating narrative, even though the book certainly had no distinguished writing. The film is remarkably faithful to the novel, even though in its three-hour length it has to telescope or eliminate many details. Coppola, using a strong narrative technique that is com ing into vogue again, expertly weaves numerous cnarac-ters and events in a straight, fast-moving story line, the history of an American Mafia clan, though all its bloody, yet absorbing, romanticized and often (sentimental progress.\\nAs Don Vito Corleone, the aging \"godfather\" of the \"famllu \" Marlnn Rrandn. who has made some unfortu nate choices in scripts in the past decade, re-establishes himself as one of the world\\'s finest actors. With thinning hair and thickening jowls, the beginnings of a sagging belly, but with an indomitable will, ruthlessness and keen psychological sense, he carries on, ruling from his Long Island fortress compound, high-walled and guarded. Through a nearly successful assassination attempt and illne6, the failing man carries on until his death, while playing in the garden with a grandson, which is curiously moving. Even though in point of footage it is not the major role, Brando dominates the film and the shadow of his inflexible power pervades those many sections of the film when other characters are examined.\\nIt is certainly as far as you could get from a stock gang chieftain portrayal, one of great strength, distinctiveness and flavor. Al Pacino, as Don Vito\\'s youngest son, Michael, who takes over the \"family\" at his father\\'s death and slaughters his way to victory over rival Mafia factions, also gives a strong performance, changing from college youth of gentle instincts to desperate killer to efficient, hard and quietly ruthless leader. James Caan as the quicktempered oldest son, Sonny, Robert Duvall as Tom Hag-en, the foster son and \"family\" consigliori or lawyer-business manager and Richard Conte as a rival gang leader are outstanding. While it does humanize the gang characters and hows that often the Don acted as a court of last resort for \"little\" people frustrated by grafting politicians and policemen, the film makes no bones about the vicious-ness and treachery of the Mafia\\'s direct action methods. It is filled with blood and violence, but the raw language and sex of the book has been surprisingly toned down.\\nThe only thing I didn\\'t like about the film was Coppola\\'s insistence of low-key, shadowy photography, perhaps because he thinks it\\'s more natural. In some scenes the characters are so much in deep shadow it\\'s hard to tell who they are..\\nUnited States\\nMissouri\\nSt. Louis\\nSt. Louis Post-Dispatch\\n1972\\nMar\\n26\\nPage 138\\nThe Godfather*\\nSubscribe\\nGift Subscriptions\\nHelp\\nSite Map\\nAbout\\nFish Wrap—Official Blog\\nAffiliates\\nContent Providers\\nUnited States (English)\\nVisit our other sites\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nInstagram\\n© 2024 Newspapers.com™ by Ancestry®.

Gardner The Godfather captures power, if not entire substance, of book - Despite what you may have read or heard to the contrary, the version of \"The Godfather\" now appearing at the Senator and Westview II is notr\\'better\" than the book.\\' Owing to the time limitation (the film runs approximately three hours), director Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo were obliged to omit large seg-. ments of the latter\\'s novel, and some of the characters in those portions that, were included lack their original depth. The women are practically ignored. They exist as types mothers, wives, mistresses, etc.\\nbut we are given little information about them, as individuals. For example, Mama Corleone, an important figure in the book, has but one or two lines of dialogue in the film. I mention these things not as a criticism, for it is difficult in a visual medium to get inside characters\\' heads the way a novelist can, and I feel that the omissions the adapters made were, without exception, wise ones., Not only have they preserved the guts of the story but they have presented it with all the pictorial force and color inherent in modern film techniques. And in this respect they may be said to have added new meat to the book\\'s bones. The result is the most compelling and comprehensive treatment of the subject perhaps ever recorded on celluloid.\\nBeside \"The Godfather\" all the classic gangster films of the Thirties seem primitive caricatures. And the performance of Marlon Brando tends to reduce those of Edward G. Robinson (in \"Little Caesar\") and James Cagney (in \"Public Enemy\") to the level of cartoons. Though the film has been beautifully and unpretentiously directed throughout, Coppola\\'s most significant contribution lies in the area of atmosphere. As was true of - the book, the story opens with the wedding party Don Corleone gives for his daughter.\\nThe compound of his Long Island estate has been carefully designed with an eye to period authenticity, and this same authentic flavor permeates all the action. Buildings no longer standing have been reconstructed. Thus we have a shot outside Jack Dempsey\\'s restaurant, as it once was, and Radio City Music Hall looks not \\'as it does now but as it did in December, 1945, when Ingrid Bergman in \"The Bells of St. Mary\\'s\" was playing there. .\\nDirector Coppola has been equally careful in his casting. Not only are most of the actors of Italian descent but, with the exception of Brando and Richard Conte, few of. them are well known to the moviegoing public. The effect, there- Isaac Rehert is on vacation and his column wiU be resumed upon his return. , C3 MARLON BRANDQ Cast and Credits \"The Godfather.\" A Paramount release.\\nProduced bv Albert 8.

The period flavor extends even to the director\\'s technique.\\nCoppola has deliberately incorporated archaic devices, such as the spinning newspaper headline, to give the impression that the film itself is a product of an earlier age. . Starting with the gala wedding receptionso real you can almost taste the pasta the story\\' moves quickly to the war that breaks out between the five Mafia families of New York when Don Corleone refuses to go along with the, others\\' decision to enlarge their operations to include narcotics. This war continues throughout the film, causing widespread death and destruction on both sides; and, though the setting shifts at times to Hollywood, Sicily and Las Vegas, most of the action occurs in. and around New York.\\n\\' The central character is the don\\'s youngest son, Michael. By mutual consent, he has stood apart from the family \"business,\" preferring to pursue a more socially acceptable career of his own choosing. But after his father has been shot down in the street, he accepts the responsibility for liquidating his would-be assassin. Then, following a period of hiding in Sicily, during which his eldest brother, Sonny, is killed, he returns to strike the blow that eliminates all the family\\'s enemies and elevates himself to the position of the most powerful man in the syndicate. It is a story of unrelieved violence, sickening in part but fascinating, no less here than in the book, in a way that cannot be denied.\\nRarely has a film of such length so thoroughly commanded my attention. Rarely have the performance of so large a cast seemed so generally right. Al Pacino does an excellent job as Michael, making the transition from a man unsophisticated in the ways of gangland violence to one capable of ordering his brother-in-law\\'s death without batting an eye.\" He chills the blood. James Caan is, an ideal Sonny, who directs the war against the family\\'s enemies with the recklessness of a high-school quarterback going into save the game during the final minutes of . play.\\nRobert Duvall is equally outstanding as the Irish Consigliori who tries to keep Sonny\\'s rashness in check. Richard Costellano makes the family\\'s principal triggerman seem both ruthless and human, and Mr. Conte, Al Lettieri, John Marley and Sterling Hayden are good in other roles. - . But it is Brando who as Don Corleone, gives the film its central core of credibility and power.\\nMade-up to look 20 years older and employing a tone of voice somewhere between, a wheeze and a croak, he succeeds in doing what he has never succeeded in doing before submerge his own Vivid personality in that of another character. In this great, gasping hulk of a man, one has difficulty recog-, nizing the hero of \"The Wild One\" and \"On the Waterfront.\" So authentic is his performance that, like the film itself, it Is almost frightening, combining dignity with vanity, tenderness with unscrupu-lousness, suffering with strength. It is a larger-than-life portrayal of a larger-than-life figure, and, even if the rest of the film failed, it alone would make \"The Godfather\" worth seeing. But the rest of the film does not fall. It is, on the contrary, one of the most successful adaptations of a book in the history of the motion-picture industry.\\nAnd those who loved the book will doubtless greet it with the same enthusiasm. \\'.\\nUnited States\\nMaryland\\nBaltimore\\nThe Baltimore Sun\\n1972\\nMar\\n24\\nPage 21\\nThe Godfather*\\nSubscribe\\nGift Subscriptions\\nHelp\\nSite Map\\nAbout\\nFish Wrap—Official Blog\\nAffiliates\\nContent Providers\\nUnited States (English)\\nVisit our other sites\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nInstagram\\n© 2024 Newspapers.com™ by Ancestry®.

A \\' ITS ALL RELATIVE Lives and deaths are planned by the powerful \"Godfather\" (Marlon Brando), in the cinema version of Mario Puzo\\'s popular novel. By Kevin Kelly Globe Staff \"The Godfather\" is an epic gangster movie adapted from the raw materials of Mario Ptrzo\\'s best-seller about the Mafia and probably the best of its kind ever made. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, it fills the screen at the Savoy with a long, leisurely, but steadily engrossing account of the mid-40\\'s. It ends with sobering intimations of how one family, the Corleones, after a lifetime of criminality, stand on the brink of respectability, like every other powerful force (political, religious, economic) that has gone into the making of this country. In its own clear-headed cynicism, in which corruption not only breeds corruption but success as well, \"The Godfather\\'s\" truth is galling but inescapable.\\nNot the least of the movie\\'s values, aside from its perfectly detailed technical accomplishment which makes it seem like a gangster melodrama made in the 1940s and just now in release, is the moral code binding together its tightly-knit families. Don Vito Corleone, the godfather, patriarchal head of his late-Sicilian clan, is a man of reason who systematically analyzes all his problems until he finds a workably solution. Ruthless as he is, by his own standards he is completely fair. Revered by his relatives (wife, three sons, one daughter, grandchildren), he is a noble figurehead (on the surface at least), a selfmade empero: whose business happens to be the underworld. When the narrative begins (a beauti fully staged paisano-scene of his daughter\\'s wedding) Don Corleone is, among other dark deals, arranging the career of a singer, a loyal Italian, who wants a part in a Hollywood movie.\\nThrough his lawyer he initiates a discussion with the movie\\'s producer, offering him a compromise, which is part of the noblesse oblige deference in the Corleone code. When the producer balks, there is a horrifying warning of vengeance, one of many. But, first, morally, the godfather has extended a choice to his opponent. The producer\\'s tentative error is that he almost chooses wrong. With this trifling matter out of the way, the movie then settles into a battle of supremacy between the ruling families, one of which is interested in beginning traffic in narcotics.\\nDon Corleone opposes the pln, but the others need the help and security of the judges, the politicians and the police he controls. In his outlook gambling is acceptable, a bona fide extension of the business and political world themselves, but narcotics are dirty, depraved, beneath the dignity of his syndicate. His attitude results in a series of reprisals against him and his family and, eventually, results in turning his one \"good\" son, Michael, to the underworld. Michael is quiet, sensitive, college-educated and a war hero. Although well-loved by the family, he\\'s somewhat apart from their murdering lives.\\nHis girl-friend is a pale, blonde schoolteacher named Kay Adams. Then, as though echoing John Donne\\'s motto: \"How much shall I be chang\\'d before I am chang\\'d,\" Michael, with all the acumen of his father, begins to assume the shape of a warlord. By the movie\\'s end, in its most devastating, perhaps its most subtlety stated analogy, Michael moves stealthily beyond the image of warlord into the status of a stateman. Director Coppola, whose Hollywood record so far has been undistinguished, tells \"The Godfather\" with a kind of brilliant, low-keyed virtuosity, with one particularly effective use of symbolism: the underworld dealings are conducted in thickly darkened rooms, usually in murmurous tones, and these scenes are contrasted with the sometimes pastoral, open- air semi-freedom of Corleone family life. The movie runs two hours and 58 minutes and it seems that long, not in restlessness but rather in the operatic sweep of all.\\nits vendettas. There is a lag, I think, during some of the episodes in Sicily, where Michael spends a year in hiding after a double-murder, but now, in retrospect, I even see those scenes as a pause, a breather in the midst of the vengeance. The score by Nino Rota, 40s pop tunes, opera and echoing church music for the climactic baptismal finale, is put to perfect use. Marlon Brando, as Don Corleone, once again establishes himself as the finest movie actor of his generation, and that\\'s the type of critical huzzah I hate because it is scattered so often on skilled automations. But if s true.\\nWith his face jowled out of shape by cotton wads in his cheeks, he looks the old man from the start, and that\\'s easy enough, but as Don Cor-leone\\'s sorrows multiply, as he comes to understand the awesome cruelties coiling out of his life, Brando somehow weights himself into wearniness. His voice is rough-whispered rasp. The performance is restrained, unac-torish, so profoundly felt that the audience is moved to admire the old man as much as it admires Brando. Al Pacino is superb as Michael, almost a younger shadow-image of Brando, but with a slightly different grasp on the terrors the character controls, just as acute as the godfather but oddly more relentless. James Caan is fine as Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall is fine as the family\\'s lawyer, and there are equally good performances from Richard Castellano, Richard Conte, Al Martino, Diane Keaton, John Mar-ley, Sterling Hayden.\\n\"The Godfather\" is an unforgettable melodrama, artfully produced.

I\\'m not burdened with having read that sensational best seller called \"The Godfather\" and finding It necessary to compare it to the movie version, which Installed itself for what will bo a very long run at the Cine Capri. Because it Is the big picture of 1971 At least, at this point For many reasons. 1. Marlon Brando, in the title role, gives his finest, most compelling performance since clutching an Oscar for \"On the Waterfront\" in 1954.\\nHe had been a consistent disappointment in so many roles since. His Don Corleone, the gangland padrone, is strong, emphatic. 2. Al Pacino, who drew attention for his portrayal of a junkie in \"Panic In Needle Park,\" emerges a full-fledged star with a brilliant low-key interpretation of Michael, the youngest Corleone son, who matures via an assortment of traumas to become the new godfather-gangleadcr upon his sire\\'s passing. 3.\\nThere is an array of notable character delineations by Robert Duvall (a heretofore underrated actor), the non-Italian lawyer-foster son, James Caan, the hotheaded older son who winds up machine-gun riddled for his hastiness; Richard Castcllano, a loyal lieutenant of both the old and new godfathers; jazx songbird Morgana King, In a small but effective role as Brando\\'s spouse; Diane Kea-ton, Paclno\\'s second wife; Abe Vigoda, the traitorous henchman, Tessio; and Al Lettieri, as the main rival gangster. Sterling Hayden, John Mar-ley and Richard Conte, in respective cameo roles of a corrupt police captain, a movie magnate pressured Into giving an aging teen-age idol (ably played by singer Al Martino) a click comeback part and a vicious underworld overiord, contribute their appreciable talents. 4. Though there are a few loose ends never quite tied together, Francis Ford Coppola merits applause for directing this sprawling tale of the gangland claque never once identified on screen as the Mafia or Cosa Nostra. THE (I understand that calling them \"families\" was acceptable to the Italian organizations which complained prior to the movie\\'s production.) Coppola, who coadapted the scenario with the lengthy novel\\'s author, Mario Puzo, pulls off a mean feat in parading so many characters and achieving a clarity of purpose with the focal ones.\\nIt is no easy chore and, as mentioned above, it falters. But the confusion is negligible. His most remarkable achievement is In establishing a superior effectiveness of mood and time, even to a special tinting, inasmuch as the period in question is the decade starting with 1945, War H\\'l end. Nino Rota\\'s attractive score, embellished by a number of pop tunes of big band days, adds to the mood\\'s brilliance. 5.\\nAny cinema which can run just five minuates shy of three hours (with no intermission) and not have me shuffling around in my seat has to be something else, even if it isn\\'t totally gripping and suspenseful. DIUMS HAL WASSON PIANO ROSY DAVIS MOAN -ACCOtDtON movie of \\'72 There are scenes which are violent and bloody, hence its R-rating. It\\'s not for the timid and queasy. But it could not score Its points without these Insightful descriptions of how the \"families\" took care of their business. Back to Brando.\\nBetween makeup and movement, his Don Corleone is fascinatingly remindful of Orson Welles as the aging \"Citizen Kane.\" What makes Marlon\\'s character etching even more glowing b the fact that he\\'s on screen only in the early and later stages. There is a vast stretch when Pacino and others must carry the ball. Yet Brando\\'s presence almost an omnipresence is always clearly felt. . In sum.\\nThe Godfather is blessed with top production values, is certain to be a powerhouse boxoffice draw, spotlights a terrific\\' performance by Padno, whom I call the Italian Dustin Hoffman, and brings Brando back to his plateau of excellence.

Al Pacino and (left) Richard Conte Derek Malcolm reviews \\' The Godfather \\' which opens this week in London and in other cities on Sunday FILMS AS SUCCESSFUL as The Godfather (opening on Thursday at the Paramount, Universal, ABC-1, and Empire, X) defy critical analysis, which tends to look at them in terms of what they have grossed . rather than what they are. it is almost impossible to be objective but at least it is possible to say that Francis Ford Coppola\\'s epic would have deserved at least a part of its financial bonanza even if it hadn\\'t been culled from Mario Puzo\\'s better than best-selling book and hadn\\'t gained all that free publicity over its difficulties with the Ma ... I mean the Brotherhood.\\nMind you, those troubles seem rather ludicrous. Without necessarily meaning to be, it turns out the best PR job for those gentlemen since God created melodrama. Indeed, I wouldn\\'t be the least surprised if they didn\\'t all trot along to the movie to study all the latest ways of making people offers they can\\'t refuse. Those who think \" Straw Dogs \" and \" Clockwork\\' Orange \" lend themselves to real-life imitation should take- a look at \" The Godfather \" for the sheer brilliance of its opportunism. It scarcely misses a trick to be in tune with the times.\\nWho\\'s for a little throat-slitting. Godfather-style? Nothing,. personal of course. Just business. , Needless to say, In \"spite of these very real doubts, I .\\nenjoyed it immensely, though three hours seemed about 25 minutes too much of even Coppola\\'s ultra-competent narrative drive. It\\'s a bloody good story, or a good bloody story and you can\\'t take that away from it. Puzo\\'s boo hasn\\'t half its artifice and style. What is more, it pretends to know what it is talking about with much more convict tion. As Richard Roud said some time\" ago in these columns, it is a first-class piece of commercial-.\" film-making, transcended by a performance from \" Marlon Brando as Corleone, head of a crumbling but still powerful crime syndicate: a staggeringly proficient cameo which Coppola observes as if he knows perfectly well that all he has to do is to train a camera on it.\\nThough the performance looks all surface with., its mask-like make-up, half-strangulated vocal delivery and physical intimations of old age, it has a core of iron underneath that never wavers. It illustrates better than anything else in the film the way that capo-mafia considers himself the very reverse of a criminal, as a law-giver concerned with the welfare of his people a puritan moralist concerned with manliness and honour. He is a dear, deadly old man with whom St Paul might wish to ingratiate himself. He almost convinces us that he is indeed, as his favourite son says, no different from any other man of power. And the\" analogy with senators and Presidents\" I don\\'t like violence.\\nI\\'m a businessman. Blood is a big expense ,J almost sticks. Nowhere else does the film measure up to the social and political significance with which Brando miraculously invests his part, though there are a dozen other very \\' good performances. Al Pacino as the slow, icy-eyed war hero who first dislikes the whole process and eventually becomes its most avid exponent, is eminently watchable. James Caan, as the tearaway son, is obviously in danger of succeeding Steve McQueen as an actorly sex-symbol.\\nRichard Castellano, Sterling Hayden, and Robert Duvall are as compulsive as we have come to expect when given half a chance. So is Richard Conte. So indeed is everybody. Coppola has a way with actors, and it shows. He also has a way with film.\\nHe can use a camera with a simple eloquence that betokens some sort of debt to Ford. Hawks, and Hathaway at his best. He enjoys creating tension b watching actors work their magic and then moving his lenses back to show that they are simply a part of a larger, more intriguing canvas. He is a classical film-maker capable of using new techniques better than most since he has acquired such a sound grasp of simple essentfals. What I think he hasn\\'t yet acquired is the courage to show us unequivocally what his own attitude is towards his subject matter.\\nI regret this film\\'s moral ambivalence. I regret its dozen or so jokey little sequences of mayhem, which the audience clap like spectators at a camp slaughterhouse. J a-n perfectly sure the film is neither as brave nor as pioneering in its pursuit of corruption as it pretends. It owes a debt to at least 20 others, including \" Scarface,\" now incidentally to be reissued. But on its own level it works, and it works brilliantly.\\nLet us pray the world isn\\'t quite as it suggests..\\nUnited Kingdom\\nEngland\\nLondon\\nThe Guardian\\n1972\\nAug\\n22\\nPage 8\\nThe Godfather*\\nSubscribe\\nGift Subscriptions\\nHelp\\nSite Map\\nAbout\\nFish Wrap—Official Blog\\nAffiliates\\nContent Providers\\nUnited States (English)\\nVisit our other sites\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nInstagram\\n© 2024 Newspapers.com™ by Ancestry®.

Life with father THE FIRST words you hear in The Godfather (Paramount, Universal, Empire and ABC I, X). no small irony in a film dedicated to the proposition that crime pays very well indeed, ring like an oath of allegiance to Uncle Sam. \\' I believe in America.\" declares a dapper little Italian, paterfamilias to the tips of his starched collar and mournful moustache. \" America has made my fortune.\\' But the aJI-American boys who beat up his daughter have got off scot-free : will Don Corleone, the Godfather, please take steps to grant him the justice he has been denied? As Mario Puzo has pointed out.\\nciting in evidence an article he wrote three years before \" The Godfather \\' wryly arguing that crime is good for America (hoodlums grow rich, turn respectable, breed pillars of society), there is a strong tinge of irony behind his presentation of the Mafia as a \\' family \\' spreading protecting wings over members who love, honour and obey. Paradox might perhaps be a better word, since the novel clinches its marvellously lucid description of how the Mafia system of \\' respect \\' operates (in flashback scenes omitted from the film) with the metamorphosis of Don Corleone from young hoodlum to venerable patriarch, a veritable Moses presiding over an Old Testament set of commandments. In a very real sense, the Godfather\\'s justice is more just than that dispensed by the American legal system. It wouldn\\'t be exactly fair to say that all this, the most fascinating aspect of Puzo\\'s novel, has been lefi on the cutting-room floor in the interests of fabricating a straifthtforward action movie \\'The Godfather \\' would probably be a better film if this were true. As it is.\\nso many garbled fragments and unexplained characters arc left lying about that the film never begins to match the pure narrative logic of. say, Gorman\\'s \\' St Valentine\\'s Day Massacre.\\' The outward manifestations of \\' family \\' loyalty, for instance, are all there, cleverly displayed in a welter of weddings, funerals, christenings and mealtimes; but the inner reverberations and demands of that loyalty are left to take care of themselves. To cite only one example: there is no hint in the film of the complex ripples caused by Don Corieone\\'s appointment of an Irishman rather than a Sicilian as his consigliere. More seriously. Puzo\\'s whole paradoxical point is compromised by the mishandling of the opening sequence.\\nWhen the suppliant offers to pay whatever justice will cost. Don Corleone (a striking performance by Brando, though he seemed in imminent danger of spitting out the cottonwool padding from his cheeks) haughtily demands respect rather than money, and purrs approvingly the moment his hand is kissed. At which point, presented with a man wallowing in flattery, the audience at the Press show quite rightly giggled. They should have been awed by a man able to command respect by his mere presence. The film therefore operates on a much more simple level than the novel, and is at its best when it functions simply as a gangster movie, at its worst when it belatedly tries to capitalise on those Puzo ironies.\\nFortunately such stylistic lapses are rare, and for the most part \\' The Godfather \\' lumbers forward as serenely and impressively as a steamroller, not only tempering its violence with frequent interludes of celebration and ceremonial, but carefully orchestrating that violence to a pitch where the final, horrific holocaust seems like an inevitable flashpoint. No matter, ultimately, that the film is strictly one-dimensional, shorn of everything but plot. Fran- lapsr cis Ford Coppola, directing with a cool non -involvement, has fashioned a fine, glossily packaged piece of computerised entertainment, never less than smooth and occasionally (the sequence with rhe Godfather menaced in an uncannily deserted hospital) almost brilliant. If I seem a little grudging about this three-hour bloodfeast sprayed with a heady bouquet of spaghetti and sentimental song, the blame lies squarely with John Huston. \\' The Godfather \\' is certainly a film to be seen, but Fat City (Columbia, AA) is one to see again and again, and will, I suspect, be around for years after \\' the film of the century \\' (I quote) has gone the way of all blockbusters.\\nReaching back to some youthful source of inspiration, or perhaps leaping forward to a new, assured mastery, it is like the later work of Ford, Bufiuel and Renoir both totally accessible and wholly private, a film shrouded in mysterious nostalgia and so effortless that it hardly seems to have been made at all. The setting is Stockton, California, a dreary wasteland of smoky bars and sun-bleached streets where the lives of two boxers briefly meet, one on the way up. one on the way down. Neither, you sense instantly, for all their talk of past successes and future glories, will ever know any other world than the back-street gymnasiums and cheap boxing-rings where battered trainers and managers swap coniidences about their ailments, enthuse over their latest discoveries, and dream of success just around the corner, and where in a sad and sobering climax two sick men beat each other half id death for a few dollars and a pint of glory. The clear but carefully understated parallel between the two boxers the older laments the wife who ruined him by running away, the younger marries a girl clearly destined to do the same never runs the 5 lightest risk of seeming schematic because what Huston is concerned with is dreams, not the reality of these despairing lives but the escape-routes they construct for themselves.\\nIt is no accident that the main visual motif of the film, stamped overall with a grimy, grainy beauty, is a direct cut from the soft nocturnal haze of the interiors to the harsh glare of the sunlight. For in the soothing glow of a smoke-filled bar anything is possible, even tenderness for a drunken whore and hopes of domestic bliss: and when the illusion is shattered by daylight, in the boxing ring or the fields where sweated labour can cam a few dollars between bouts, the bars still hold their promise of attainable dreams. There is perhaps one false note in the entire him, a shot briefly and quite unnecessarily frozen near the end to underline the meaning of the magnificent final sequence. Otherwise \" Fat City,\\' with superb performances by Stacy Keach. Jeff Bridges and Susan Tyrrell, seems 10 me to be perfection.\\nOn LONDON next.\\nUnited Kingdom\\nEngland\\nLondon\\nThe Observer\\n1972\\nAug\\n27\\nPage 24\\nThe Godfather/Fat City\\nSubscribe\\nGift Subscriptions\\nHelp\\nSite Map\\nAbout\\nFish Wrap—Official Blog\\nAffiliates\\nContent Providers\\nUnited States (English)\\nVisit our other sites\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nInstagram\\n© 2024 Newspapers.com™ by Ancestry®.

Both are big films, in terms of ambition, production and accomplishment. Both are important, in the development of American movie-making, and in what\\'s happening in America itself.\\nIn short, both movies are blockbusters. Gone With the Wind has been in continuous circulation for over 30 years now, and if The Godfather doesn\\'t last quite that long, it\\'s certainly not going to make an early exit. The heyday of the Mtfia in America, the age of the stud in the black shirt and white tie sitting in a nightclub with a bulge in his jacket, is over. The era of the machine gun in the violin case and the gang war in the streets is all but gone. MYTH Crooked congressmen mav still abound, and somebody is still out there running the gambling and drug syndicates, but the great Sicilian clansman has eased himself into a comfortable niche in American mythology.\\nHe\\'s no longer the sinister heavy he was so colorfully for so long. In this age of corporate slickness, fast-talking and conglomeration have replaced the bullets and muscle of yesteryear. Italians have become solid, respectable members of the American establishment. They don\\'t even want to be reminded of past days when, probably for no more than a tiny hanfu\\', the underworld was the only ticket to wealth and respect. But for the rest oc us, the Mafia is a subject of endless fascination.\\nIts code of honor appeals to us at a time when our own standards of morality have broken down. Its entrepreneurial zeal strikes our own natural competitive sense, and its operations, not anti-society but ultra-society, are well in tune with this rebellious age. VALACHI Thus the Mafia has become a super-popular item in our written and filmic literature. Valachi sang and started it off. Jimmy Breslin said it was all a joke.\\nGay Talese made a moving human drama out of it. And Mario Puzo told it, a\\' little romantically perhaps, how it really was. Puzo\\'s story of The Godfather has become The Mafia handbook. Sales of 650,000 hardcover editions and a whopping 10 million pocket-books testify to that. And the film version is the\" clincher.\\nThe transformation of the Godfather to the screen was the biggest news out of Hollywood in years. Directors battled for the honor of making it, and actors vied for the glory of starring in it. Its production was shrouded with the sort of pseudo-secrecy that used to be accorded only to Greta Gar-bo. And, of course, there was air that mix-up with the Italian-American Anti-Defamation League, and the miraculous end to union hassles as soon as a deal was siped. MONEY-MAKER When the movie finally got out, as it \"did last week in New York City, it immediately began to make, more money faster than anything in memory.\\nAnd when it opened in Montreal, yesterday at the Loew\\'s, the theatre had more peopie in it at 9.30 in the morning than it normally does on a Friday night. Obviously, The Godfather (the movie) has something. And what it has is Class. It would have been so easy to make another simplistic, greasy movie abou\\' the Macia where people died in pools of blood and talked like-a-dis-a. But The Godfather isn\\'t like thaL There\\'s violence (boy! is i there ever) and there\\'- more j s ::\\':: :.\\'::\\' -.\\nf ; $ \\' i.i\\'.m; 1 1 :: L - -- Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan and John Cazale . . . father and sons than a few cliches about Italian-Americans and their lifestyle. But everything in the movie has been handled with restraint and what can best be described as good taste.\\nMarlon Brando\\'s performance as the Mafia chieftain is, as expected, exceptional. He was superbly made-up for the role, but thrt\\'s rn\\'y part of it. The character he developed, of a man who mut balance mam\\' forces and direct a hu?e organization, is very fine. WEDDING When the .film opens we find him celebrating at the wedding of his daughter and at the same time, handling the requests and needs of the little people as a Medieval prince might. He is soft- \\' spoken, kind, understanding and just.\\nBrando disappears for much of the film, but the movie doesn\\'t let up. His sons, played by James Caan, Al Pacino, and John Cazale, carry on his mb\"e trditions. They are obliged to wipe several people off the face of the earth, to garrot them o rhoot them, but the sense of justice remains. Yet violence is not all the family h good at. Their scenes together, most of them anvway.\\nare exact!\" what the close American fami\\'y is su?-)osed to be. Again, there\\'s u n d e r st?nding, \\'love and warmth. The stop of The Godfather is about the Gor\\'fa\\'ber\\'- crim-ina\\' family and its battles with other Mafia \\'amilies over the developing trade in narcotics. The f\\'ght starts off quite small, but the Simian code of honor demands blood for blood, and the battles build. The film is three hours long, but it keeps an admirable pace throughout.\\nThere are no labored slow spots, and there is no intermission you wouldn\\'t want one. There a r c hundreds of people in the cast, almost all of them unfamiliar faces. But every face looks just as it should, and the acting that goes with it flawless. The image of the Mafia in The Godfather is one of a tightly-knit, usually well-func-tioning organization that exists because somebodv has to cater to the gambling, prostitution and drug needs of straight society. Some of the boys may fight a bit too much, but essentially they\\'re honorable, hard-working and honest people just like everybody else.\\n\\' In fact, it\\'s the thesis of the film that the Mafia is a company just like any other, right down to their aims (to make money and keep going) and their methods. One of the Mafia chieftain\\'s sons is a war-hero he was a hero for killing people who becomes a Mafioso he is a criminal for killing people. The Mafia may be ruthless and cold and it may kill people, but, here anyway, it\\'s little more than a microcosm of American society. The backgrounds in the film are fantastic, a tremendously impressive recreation of the 1940s and \\'50s. The street scenes are out of yesteryear, as are the clothes, the mannerism\", tha billboards and tha cars where thev ever \"ays J Adults LEFS FLAYCOSTCI in VIVID COLOR With D0CTOfiNOON 235.5 0S.735.BB GIRLS 120.55.6Z5.and8 I H4 HJMliT nmi tavra ftifi Si; I 1 got all those old Cadillacs and Packards and Dodges is a mystery.\\nIt\\'s another mystery how Francis Ford Coppola ever put this movie together. He was signed as director early in The Godfather\\'s filmic development, and apparently he was instrumental in guiding its growth from another cheap gangster film to the definitive picture of an important slice of life in America. Coppola was previously successful as a scriptwriter (he shared an Oscar for writing Patton) but his past things at directing have ranged from unremarkable (Finian\\'s Rainbow) to pretentious and bad (The Rain People). Then all of a sudden he turns up doing \\'the biggest picture in years and doing a great job at it. It is definitely a good sign for movie-making in America.\\nAfter years of blockbusters that were dreary duds it\\'s nice .to. see a studio put up millions to make a movie and have something good come of it, even if it is followed by a flood of second-rate Mafia movies as The Godfather probably will be. It\\'s also nice that someone of Coppola\\'s youth (he\\'s in his early 30s) was the man to do it. His success, and that of several other college-trained cineastes, speaks well for the future of Hollywood. But what is nicest of all is that an entertainment film like The Godfather should turn out as interesting and as funny and as moving and even as violent and as entertaining as it did.\\nPendulum Theatre P.V.M.

The one overwhelming impression, which submerges even that of ruthless men in pursuit of worthless goals, is that of the family the ultimate power base, the one constant in a world of utter inconstancy.\\n\"Never a real man\" As the godfather himself puts it: \"A man who doesn\\'t spend time with his family can never be a real man.\" And nor apparently can the man who doesn\\'t spend the rest of the time decimating other people\\'s families. The godfather himself is supreme. He is able to grant any favor that a bullet, or the threat of one, can procure. He can sentence to death, and in conjunction with other godfathers, impose peace. Don Vito Corleone is the head of one of the New York area\\'s five families.\\nHe is played by Marlon Brando in a faultless portrayal of patrician dignity and\" underlying menace. He is gunned down and recovers, and the oldest son takes over. He in turn is shot and another son Bernardi to conduct in U.S. at the Belle Claire GERRY -JOLY Mario Bernardi, conductor of the National Arts Centre Orchestra, has been invited to conduct the Chicago succeeds and Vito is left to die in retirement, playing with his grandson in a tomato patch. Brando\\'s total authority and the\\' skill with which he masters every nuance of the aging process, linger in the mind long after the savagery is forgotten.\\nWell-learned lesson Of his sons, James Caan plays the untamed tiger with such enthusiasm it\\'s plain that he won\\'t last long. On the other hand there is Michael, the unwilling recruit who learns his father\\'s lesson too well and plans the act of his rivals\\' extermination even as the priest at his own godson\\'s christening asks him, \"Do you renounce Satan and all his works?\" Al Pacino, with a deceptive blffndness in his approach early on, works up to a nicely controlled explosion of cynical assassination. The choice of Cappola as director may not have rested entirely on his Italian-American background but whatever the . reason, it helps. He has the right sense of occasion which the Mafia brings to its family festivals and ritual revenges and uses it sensitively to let the system spell out its own condemnation.\\nHe chooses to be quite explicit about the violence, but there is nothing more stomach-turning here than we have seen in a succession of recent films, and for once it belongs to the story. He is especially strong on contrasts. Some of these are subtle and subdued, as when the New York branch of the Mafia meets in a board-room atmosphere, or in that idyllic interlude in Sicily when Michael does his courting with an armed guard and others comes across with brutal clarity. The Godfather is three hours long and there is no interval. Hopefully this is an indication that cinema management is at last aware that, given this kind of fare, an audience can survive without its hourly popcorn..\\nCanada\\nOntario\\nOttawa\\nThe Ottawa Citizen\\n1972\\nMar\\n29\\nPage 34\\nThe Godfather*\\nSubscribe\\nGift Subscriptions\\nHelp\\nSite Map\\nAbout\\nFish Wrap—Official Blog\\nAffiliates\\nContent Providers\\nUnited States (English)\\nVisit our other sites\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nInstagram\\n© 2024 Newspapers.com™ by Ancestry®.

Some are born great, some have greatness thrust upon them ... by the vast publicity machine. jThe Godfather (Barclay and Chelsea, R) has already made it, due to the blockbusting popularity of Mario Puzo\\'s book, the publicity associated with the film\\'s making and (in America, where it has grossed an unbelievable $75 million in three months) a special interest in its very indigenous subject matter. I doubt If Australia can match this kind of ethnic fascination, despite Mr.\\nSnedden\\'s timely announcements, for which the local film trade must be thanking its lucky (Hollywood) stars. Francis Ford Coppola\\'s three-hour film is undoubtedly effective in its genre, a superior gangland epic. But that is all. Knowledge of the book must make a big difference: the audience around me seemed to know tvery incident in advance and fit it easily into place in the complex pattern. ..\\nI saw The Godfather merely as a very long, very sensationalist, very violent melodrama about a close-knit family of the New York-New Jersey Mafiosa; powerful enough, although the power comes mainly from the staging of its numerous cold-blooded killings. Coppola is an Intelligent young scripter-director, hitherto specialising in lighter entertainments, and this \"Gone .With The Wind of gangster films\" is a clever mixture of Italian-American domestic detail and vengeful death. Here is Big Business Sicilian-style, monopoly attained \\'by murder instead of merger\". The paterfamilias himself is played . by Marlon Brando in a soft rasping voice with characterful gestures.\\nHe is always worth watching, but the performance relies too heavily on disguise plastic skin, and jowls swollen as though suffering permanent toothache to be ranked among the great Brando characterisations. The godfather is gunned down for refusing to add narcotics to his list of rackets. The sons take over, one (James Caan) meeting a worse fate, a younger one (Al Pacino) surviving the beatings, machine-gunnings and garrotings and, after a spell hidden away in Sicily, turning from fresh young scion into cold hood-in-chief. Playing is all good, set pieces headed by the vicious circle of street and cafe killings \\' awe\\' \\' somely staged, pictorial values (in old-fashioned . Technicolor to match the \\'forties period) nothing to write home about.\\nThe Mafia or Cosa Nostra is unpleasantly romanticised. A dynasty of respectable, hypocritical, racist\\' thugs is lent more than its share of humanity and -sympathy by the acting. For example, not one mention is made of the victims of the loyal old family\\'s racketeering. And surely, this kind of American mythologising passes over (or under) many Australian heads. Give \\' me the gripping, naive old Warner Bros, formula of Cagney, Robinson and Bogart every time.\\nFor all its pace and detail, these three hours make fairly heavy going, for there ds no interval for a leg-stretch and relief from death. Candice Bergen, daughter of Charlie McCarthy\\'s ventriloquist, is a lovely and talented young woman who deserves better than the two films olsted on her this week.

Some of the satirical flashbacks to her life in a corporation office are entertaining, although her frank and fey sense of humor becomes a mite too whimsical for comfort and the whole idea of Candice Bergen staying lonely in a big city for long is too improbable for words.\\nPeter Hyams wrote and Herbert Ross directed this bittersweet bedroom conversation piece.

And no wonder. \"The Godfather\" is one of thore rare films which works on just about every level. It it is entertainment: it is art. Superficially exciting with a strong narrative sense and rapid-fire yet consistent action, it is also provocative and deeply disturbing.\\nI haven\\'t read the Mario Puzo novel from which Puzo and director Francis Ford Coppola adapted the film, but I doubt that in this case a familiarity with the original is particularly necessary. Basically, the film is the story of a Sicilian crime syndicate\\'s operations in New York in the late Forties and early Fifties. It is a story of power and the way power is organised. It is also as fine a portrait of an ethnic subculture as I have ever seen. Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the Don, the head of one of New York\\'s five ruling crime \"families.\" When the Don refuses to deal in narcotics, he is gunned down by a rival syndicate and while he recovers, his sons ascend in the Corleone family.\\nThe result is gang warfare extending over a period of almost a decade. This plot itself, with its intricate pattern of who will get it next and how, is enough to make the film a success. But Coppola gives us so much more. We are taken into the family, into the intimate structure of power and purpose. The family, we see, is a patriarchal structure in which women and children are relegated to pedestals on the periphery.\\nPower is a man\\'s game in which loyalty and cunning are the chief requirements. Nothing can save the man who violates either requirement. Violence is the means of enforcement. And in the name of power, violence is always premeditated. The worM of the family is in no way connected to the day-by-day petty crimes of passion and pain the pointless bashings, rapes, robberies and murders which seem the more direct threat to most of us.\\nThe violence is something much bigger than we can begin to comprehend. But the family understands it, as do the politicians and big businessmen who ally themselves to the family. There is no morality in this kind of power. The Don refuses to deal in drugs not because they are evil but because drug traffic might offend his political contacts. In the world of \"The Godfather,\" a good and respected man is a powerful man.\\nHe runs his business well and provides for his family (meaning all who are loyal to him). If he runs his business well, he will be rewarded, as the Don is, with a peaceful death in the sunlight of his family\\'s love. The emphasis is on the playing, and the performances Coppola draws from his actors are almost without exception faultless. Brando proves at last that his superb command has not been diminished by a decade of indifferent parts. Perhaps more exciting are the portrayals of the Don\\'s four sons: James Caan as the auick-tcmpered Sonny; Robert Duvall as the adopted son whose legal education and soft voice cannot disguise his street-fighter\\'s love of the machinations of power-seeking; John Cazale as Fredo, simple, even dull, but loyal to anyone who will show him kindness.\\nMost outstanding is AI Pacino as the Don\\'s youngest and favourite son Michael, who grows from a shy, college-educated war hero, uninvolved in the family\\'s business, to the worthy successor to his father\\'s role..\\nAustralia\\nNew South Wales\\nSydney\\nThe Sydney Morning Herald\\n1972\\nJul\\n17\\nPage 7\\nThe Godfather*\\nSubscribe\\nGift Subscriptions\\nHelp\\nSite Map\\nAbout\\nFish Wrap—Official Blog\\nAffiliates\\nContent Providers\\nUnited States (English)\\nVisit our other sites\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nInstagram\\n© 2024 Newspapers.com™ by Ancestry®.

The period is the decade of gang wars (1945-55). What takes the picture out of the Cagney-Raft-Bogard genre.\\nwith their phoney piety, is that these mobsters are portrayed as people.

Francis Ford Coppola took Mario Puzo’s epic novel and turned it into a masterpiece.  More than that, one book would become the basis for three different films.  This is before Puzo decided to write a sequel to his novel.\\nMarlon Brando stars as Don Vito Corleone, the head of the Corleone crime family.  When we first meet the family, it’s the day of Connie’s (Talia Shire) wedding to Carlo (Gianni Russo).  There is nothing like a wedding when it comes to introducing us to all of the major characters.  Coppola delivers a fine balance between family life and the criminal side in showing their rise in power over a period of ten years.  The film’s main focus is on Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) as he goes from being a family outsider to replacing his father as boss.\\nThis is one of those films where I don’t feel the need to really dive into plot details.  The film not only would make Pacino’s career but Brando got a second life.  Coppola is one of the earliest filmmakers to be on his own during the start of New Hollywood.  Twelve filmmakers would turn down the directing gig before Coppola signed onto direct.  Coppola almost became the thirteenth but he changed his mind.\\nMuch to Paramount’s dismay, Coppola shot the film on location.  Moreover, the studio wanted to make drastic changes to the film.  They wanted to move the film to a contemporary setting in Kansas City.  This would certainly have brought about a lesser film if you ask me.  Thankfully, Coppola won out both in shooting on location in New York/Sicily and with the 1945-1955 time period.  Even on casting, it’s really hard to watch the film and envision anyone else in the roles.  Yet at one point, Al Pacino wasn’t even playing Michael!  When everything was settled, Pacino was Michael and James Caan was Sonny.  It is always amazing to see how casting evolves from pre-production to just before and even during production.\\nOverall, the film would earn ten Oscar nominations, winning three for Best Picture, Actor (Marlon Brando), and Adapted Screenplay (Puzo and Coppola).  Brando famously boycotted and refused to accept his Oscar win citing the treatment of Native Americans in Hollywood.  Pacino, nominated for Supporting Actor, didn’t attend because he had more screen time than Brando.  Despite the lead billing, Brando is only in the film for an hour of its three-hour run time.  The film also features one of the top movie quotes of all time: “I’ll make him an offer he can’t refuse.”\\nDIRECTOR:  Francis Ford Coppola\\nSCREENWRITERS:  Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola\\nCAST:  Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, Diane Keaton\\nParamount Pictures opened The Godfather on March 14, 1972.

It is a three-hour movie about the Mafia, released in 1972 by a studio that had been losing money at a steady clip, directed by an up-and-coming filmmaker whose last film had been a major flop (he was hired, in large part because the desperate studio knew that he wasn\\'t in a position to turn down work), adapted from a bestselling potboiler the the director regarded as sleazy trash, with a cast headlined by a former star who had spent a full decade squandering his career, developing a reputation for being combative and undisciplined. All of which just goes to show.\\n\\nSince the film is one of the all-time consensus masterpieces, and since I haven\\'t the slightest intention of troubling that consensus, I hope you will permit me to begin by talking about the things The Godfather gets wrong? Because, in faith, I don\\'t actually think it\\'s perfect, and I don\\'t rate it in the top ten movies of all time, or whatever - not even in the top 100, if you can imagine such wickedness. I would rank it third among Francis Ford Coppola\\'s films of the 1970s in terms of quality, and fourth in terms of how interesting I find it. There is, I believe, a way in which it is too clean in its novelistic grandeur; it is a film that does not need a viewer to affirm its greatness. The Conversation, The Godfather, Part II and Apocalypse Now all make demands that we do the work of solving them (and that\\'s saying nothing about Coppola\\'s amazing run of luminous messes after the Big Four); The Godfather presents itself, pure and immaculate and complete.\\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\\n\\n\\nSo anyway, the things that the film gets wrong. It has some shaggy pacing, I believe, and a baggy shape, mostly prior to Michael\\'s (Al Pacino) trip to Italy - and I assume it\\'s okay if I don\\'t even bother with the loosest ghost of a plot summary? I don\\'t want to get into all the complicated nitty gritty, and it seems bizarre to pretend that most people don\\'t know the broad strokes. Anyway, prior to that point (which is very close to exactly halfway through the film), there are a lot of scenes that loosely contribute to the film\\'s mood, but give it a kind of aggressive shapelessness. Then, in the second half, the pace becomes mercilessly swift, summarising months and years in individual scenes; it feels almost like a different movie, an impressionistic montage of how the U.S. Mafia redefined itself in the decade following World War II. If I can just go right ahead and make a complete ass of myself, I think one of the scenes I\\'d definitely cut is the \"horse head in the bed\" sequence: it is making precisely the same point that was already made by Michael\\'s \"my father made him an offer he couldn\\'t refuse\" speech to Kay (Diane Keaton), and there, it was a character beat, establishing through Pacino\\'s thin, atonal recital of the anecdote that Michael is slightly disgusted by his family, not just giving us the exposition of who the family is. The horse head scene feels like a relic from an earlier conception of the film, one where we view the Corleones from outside; it is I think the only scene that takes place entirely outside the POV of any character attached to the family, and it feels a little off-kilter.\\n\\nSpeaking of Kay: she\\'s an aggressively under-developed character, and the final shot badly needs her not to be. Keaton was not, at this point in her career, confident enough in creating a personality to push against the limits of the screenplay\\'s imagination; in her hands, and as Coppola and Mario Puzo (author of the source novel) imagine the character in writing her, Kay comes across as an empty vessel, an observer who at best stands in for a thematic point earmarked for later refinement. And on the subject of acting, I don\\'t really get all the love for Marlon Brando\\'s Vito Corleone; he strikes me as extremely over-fussed and too transparent in its mechanics, between the husky, whispering voice, the way he absently scratches his face with his very thoughtfully posed hand, the way he over-relies on the prosthetic that puffs out his jaw. It surely could have been worse: Coppola\\'s other choice was Laurence Olivier, and I cannot imagine what a weird camp object that performance would have been. The studio\\'s other choice was Ernest Borgnine, which would have been at least better, but I suspect he would have focused on making the character threatening and lost sight of the familial affection that is the strongest part of Brando\\'s performance.\\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\\n\\n\\nThere is a really incredibly shitty cut a little bit before the two-hour mark, when Talia Shire is stepping over to pick up a phone. That is, I think, the whole list.\\n\\nThe thing about reviewing The Godfather, of course, is that it\\'s The Godfather, one of those films about which there is simply nothing left to say. I am not even sure if there was anything left to say in 1972. We all know the deal: the film tells a miraculous four-pronged story, in its ten-year narrative about the soft decline in power of the Corleone crime family. Most abstractly, it is about the United States of America in the middle of the 20th Century, settling into its role as a superpower after WWII, a role it acquired through an act of blinding violence. Most concretely, it is a new-fashioned version of the wonderful old gangster pictures that were one of Hollywood\\'s greatest products in the early sound years, prior to the Hays Office growing teeth in 1934; it relates the rituals and politicking within the high-level power structure of the Mafia with documentary like precision as well as florid soap-operatic excess, both of them so definitive that we\\'re getting close to a full half-century of Mafia films and television that are all, even the very greatest of them, basically just wrinkles on The Godfather\\'s model. In between, it is a story about the tension between tradition and assimilation in immigrant populations, as populations viewed as non-people by the WASP masters of the universe find niches in disreputable and antisocial corners of the world, and gain power and respect that way. And it is a morality play about Michael Corleone, the man who begins the movie acknowledging full of righteous disgust for his sociopathic father, and ends the movie as a more vicious, calculating bastard than Daddy every daydreamed about being. I personally favor the last of these, and this is a large part of the reason I prefer Part II which goes in much harder on that theme. But part of the greatness of The Godfather is that it can genuinely be all things to all people.\\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\\n\\n\\nPlenty of that greatness resides squarely in the writing - I have not read Puzo\\'s novel, but by all accounts its a shadow of the rich tapestry of characters and social currents that the film script is. And notwithstanding my grumpiness about the macro-structure of the film, it\\'s hard to deny that this is a tremendous accomplishment, weaving large motifs and small little character beats in and around each other with both bombast and nuance; it is one of the genuinely operatic films in this respect. Hell, even the structure is certainly doing something, it\\'s not just a random mess. The first sixth of the film\\'s running time, after all, is dedicated to one afternoon, and the sprawling spectacle of an Italian-American wedding with plenty of money to spend (it\\'s impossible to imagine the glorious indulgence of The Deer Hunter and its own opening act dedicated to a wedding in an ethnic enclave without The Godfather clearing the road for it); it\\'s a brilliant sequence, honestly my favorite part of the whole film for how neatly it presents the characters and their dynamics, as well as the heavy emphasis on a kind of thickly underscored performance of Italianicity; how it creates a jarring contrast between the sickly brightness of the outdoor where the Corleone family plays and the clotted, shadowy lair where Don Corleone manipulates his crime empire; how it lets the fact that this is a Mafia don\\'s family slowly wash over us, performing exposition through innuendo rather than declarations. And after this point, the film is built around an idea of acceleration: thirty minutes to cover an afternoon, sixty minutes to cover a year, the Sicilian interlude that feels like it belongs to another movie entirely, sixty minutes to cover nine years. Especially in its last 40 minute or so, the sudden rush of scenes launching across time gives the film the sensation of things sprawling out of control, the characters\\' destinies locked in by fate rather than their willful, considered choices, which seemed to guide things up to the moment that Michael shoots those guys in the restaurant. Call it whatever you like: stability versus violent chaos, Vito\\'s steady wisdom versus Michael\\'s impulsive reactions. Whatever it is, it\\'s baked into the rhythm of the whole film, and it works damn well.\\n\\nIf it\\'s not the script being terrific, it\\'s the outstanding cast and crew Coppola assembled, with help and hindrance from Paramount under the dictatorial hand of Robert Evans. First among equals - and I include Coppola himself, here - is surely Gordon Willis, the genius cinematographer of his generation, who in The Godfather executed what I would not really hesitate in declaring the most important work of photography of the New Hollywood Cinema. Movies did not look like this before The Godfather; they barely looked like it afterwards, though at least Willis laid out a whole new toolkit for people to tentatively, nervously play with. The obvious thing is his fearless, radical use of deep, oppressive shadows, smothering interiors in gaping pools of black, burying actors\\' in pits of nighttime maleveolence. One sometimes hears the suggestion that a problem with The Godfather is that it makes the Mafia life, with its rigid codes of macho behavior, seem luxurious and honorable and attractive; and given how it has been received, that\\'s a fair complaint. But it\\'s impossible to blame the film for that: setting aside the issue of how sickening and bleak Michael\\'s fall is, and the gutted look on Keaton\\'s face in the brutal final shot (a candidate for the best final shot in all of cinema, obviously - and still not my favorite final shot of a Godfather film, which speaks to how well-made these movies are), I don\\'t see how anybody with eyes could look at the necrotic shadows Wills bathes every space and every face is, and claim that The Godfather makes this look appealing. It is a heavy, oppressive visual world, made up rich painterly tableaux of gloom. The only part of the film that looks genuinely beautiful in a conventional way is the Sicilian sequence, where Coppola and Willis stop making a New Hollywood film and start making an Italian movie; the look grows soft and diffuse, the colors smooth out - for the next most obvious thing, after all the shadows, is that Willis exposed and developed the film to exaggerate the tendency already found in American stock of that period to go towards yellow and brown. The result is a film that makes the dinginess of early-\\'70s cinematography an unabashed strength, skewing everything towards yellow in a way that adds a patina of nostalgia but also toxicity. In Sicily, this yellowness feels warmer and sunnier.\\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\\n\\n\\nIt also shifts to having a more robustly Italian score, which I bring up mostly because you can\\'t write about The Godfather without genuflecting at Nino Rota, a composer who had no end of triumphs, and a couple candidates for Best Score of All Time in his collaborations with Federico Fellini. He has another candidate right here, notwithstanding that the main theme associated with Sicility was taken intact from his music for the 1958 Fortunella, directed by Eduardo Di Filippo (from a Fellini script!). Even before the film begins, we get a taste of Rota\\'s strategy, in the extremely sad-sounding horns that introduce the first statement of the Godfather Waltz, a delectably complicated and tricky motif that is, on the surface, romantic and refined and stately, but has a spider-like quality waiting to pounce on us after the full statement of the main melody completes. It is beauty that hides a venomous, malicious undertone - much like the world of brutal thugs with nice homes, nice clothes, and a well-developed sense of honor that the waltz accompanies.\\n\\nThe cast, outside of the significant cases of Brando and Keaton, is also superb throughout. Al Pacino is the star of the show, a working actor who had his well-deserved breakout here, letting evil creep into his portrayal of Michael slowly, and always painted as worn-out pragmatism; really, until he lies to Kay at the end, there\\'s never a point where Pacino clearly wants us to see that Michael knows what he\\'s doing. It\\'s less wide-ranging than he\\'ll get to be in the sequel (where he is the unabashed lead, rather than at the forefront of a busy ensemble), but it\\'s stellar work, especially given that Pacino has to make sure we understand what\\'s changing in Michael during the chronologically manic final hour. But as easy as it is to single him out, there are brilliant performances at every turn, from the very obvious (Robert Duvall being handed every one of his muted reactions on a silver platter by the director) to the slightly less obvious (James Caan\\'s impetuous, violence-prone Sonny is a gangster movie cliché grounded in surprising choices about where to reveal the character\\'s terror and self-doubt - check out his line readings in the \"we don\\'t discuss business at the table\" scene for an especially sharp example), to the not very obvious at all (Abe Vigoda\\'s portrayal of his character\\'s final scene, contentment and resignation mixed with just a molecule of hope that there\\'s a way out of this that doesn\\'t involve his own death, is a contender for my favorite single scene of a performance in the film).\\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\\n\\n\\nIt is, that is to say, a terrifyingly complete work, impressive in every way, an exemplar of every aspect of the filmmaker\\'s craft, and so oferstuffed in the ideas it depicts and the themes it explores that it feels like you can watch an entirely new film with a whole new message every time you turn it on. Given how hectic and unpleasant the shoot was, and how little he believed in the project at the onset, it\\'s astonishing how strong of a guiding hand Coppola keeps on the whole affair; this is one of those movies where every single collaborator is doing such incredible work that you can\\'t help but want to ascribe all the success to the director making sure they\\'re all lined up, weirdly enough. As much as I bristle when the film\\'s loudest fans suggest that it\\'s obviously the pinnacle of filmmaking, or at least American filmmaking, or at least American filmmaking in the \\'70s (it is the only perfect five-star masterpiece that I would also be inclined to describe as \"overrated\"), there\\'s no denying that this is a consummate achieve that deserved all of its considerable financial and critical success, and has completely earned the exciting freshness that still clings to it nearly half a century later. Hard as its themes get, and for as long as it is, this is one of the most compulsively watchable of great films, and that counts for just as much as the immaculate craft does.\\n\\nReviews in this series\\nThe Godfather (Coppola, 1972)\\nThe Godfather, Part II (Coppola, 1974)\\nThe Godfather, Part III (Coppola, 1990)\\nCATEGORIES: BEST FILMS OF ALL TIME, CRIME PICTURES, DOMESTIC DRAMAS, FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA, GANGSTER PICTURES, GORGEOUS CINEMATOGRAPHY, NEW HOLLYWOOD CINEMA, OSCAR\\'S BEST PICTURE\\nBill & Ted\\'s Bogus Journey (1991)\\nThe Loved Ones (2009)\\nSubscribe\\nConnect With Us\\nSupport The Show\\nCopyright © 2024 Alternate Ending - Discovering good movies, one bad movie at a time.\\nWordPress Development by Gibson Web Development\\nThis product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.'}, {'ReviewID': 59, 'Critic': 'Log In\\nYour Night In: Every movie on TV tonight rated\\nAn enduring quotable classic dubbed one of the greatest movies of all time versus a global box office phenomenon about a sparkly vampire finding love.

Why am I doing this? Because the damned cinemas are closed and I have to review something.\\n\\n(MA15+) ★★★★★\\n\\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola.\\n\\nCast: Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, Al Lettieri, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, Gianni Russo, John Cazale, Rudy Bond, Al Martino, Morgana King, Lenny Montana, Johnny Martino, Salvatore Corsitto.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know how to break this to you Al, but I\\'m not wearing any pants.\"\\n\\nThere\\'s one thing The Godfather does better than any other film - it makes you happily watch the ultimate corruption of a decent human being, and makes you cheer him along on his downward journey.\\n\\nIt\\'s different to other \"bad guy\"-focused films. This is not the society-crushes-spirit of Joker, where we pity Arthur Fleck and what the world has turned him into. Nor is it the over-the-top satires of the villain-centric American Psycho or A Clockwork Orange, or the good-guy-does-bad-things-for-good-reasons story of Taxi Driver. The Godfather\\'s \"hero\" Michael Corleone chooses to do the things he does. He never has to do them, and as much as he is fuelled by revenge, that revenge is fuelled by his own willingness for said revenge, and by his willingness to accept the blood that flows through his veins. At the start of the film, he makes it clear he has rejected his family\\'s lifestyle - by the end he epitomises it.\\n\\nThe Godfather leaves you confused and dirty, yet fulfilled and satisfied, kind of like having great sex with someone you definitely shouldn\\'t sleep with.\\n\\nThe film invites you into bad places you\\'ve never been and makes it all seem okay. This complicitness with the dark side starts with its portentous opening shot. It\\'s a three-minute-long tracking shot of a shadowy, serious figure in a dimly lit room, pleading for a special kind of justice unavailable outside this nondescript location. It is beautifully filmed, intricately lit, and features a stirring monologue by Salvatore Corsitto (who appeared in just one other movie outside of The Godfather).\\n\\nAs Corsitto intones his horrifying tale, we are immediately drawn into a secret world with its warped views of respect, honour and family. The craft of Coppola\\'s three-hour opus about an Italian-American crime syndicate is perfect, but it\\'s the way it lets us into a hitherto-unseen world of deals and deaths that keeps us spellbound.\\n\\n\\nIn the almost 50 years since its release, The Godfather has become the gold standard in mob movies; so much so, some mobsters used it as \"how to\" guide while others claimed it was like looking in a mirror. Regardless, The Godfather\\'s reputation for greatness in part comes not from its veracity of the mafia lifestyle, but from a perceived authenticity. Most of us have no idea what mob life in the \\'40s and \\'50s was like, but The Godfather makes it seem like it was exactly like The Godfather says it was. And this stems from the perfection in its production design, and the truth that rings through the characters and their stories.\\n\\n(Sidenote: there are children everywhere in The Godfather, but not in prominent roles. They\\'re just there, like they are in real life. This goes a long way towards subtly and subconsciously selling the realism of the movie.)\\n\\nStanley Kubrick once said The Godfather \"was possibly the greatest movie ever made and certainly the best cast\". On that last note, he\\'s spot on. Remarkably, Pacino, Caan and Duvall were all nominated for best supporting actor at the 1972 Oscars. Perhaps even more remarkably, they lost out to Joel Grey, who won for his incandescent turn as the MC in Bob Fosse\\'s Cabaret.\\n\\n(Fosse also edged out Coppola for best director, and Cabaret won eight out of its 10 nominations. But The Godfather managed to win best film and best screenplay, as well as best actor for Brando, who famously refused the award, sending indigenous American rights activist Sacheen Littlefeather in his place.)\\n\\nAwards aside, its two key performances are lightning in a bottle. It reveals relative newcomer Pacino as an incredible talent (in only his third film) and captures Brando\\'s last truly great turn (even though he had nearly three decades of film-making ahead of him). Individually they\\'re stunning; together they elevate the film to somewhere special. Capturing Pacino on the ascent and final peak from Brando is the kind of unforeseeable magic that helps make a movie a classic.\\n\\nMuch like Scorsese\\'s recent epic The Irishman, Coppola\\'s The Godfather is riveting and perfectly paced across its 180 minutes. It never feels overlong or rushed, and it\\'s regularly punctuated by shocking moments that floor you. It\\'s tempo is old-school, but its first half an hour or so introduces so much - the threat of violence, the large cast, the themes of family and respect, and the wealth and reach of the Godfather\\'s enterprise, all via a grand wedding. Within this time frame we also get two iconic moments - the horrific use of a horse\\'s head, and the first of many variations on the signature line \"I\\'ll make him an offer he can’t refuse\".\\n\\nThese now-oft-parodied elements have helped sustain the film\\'s legacy, along with the likes of \"Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes\", the gunning-down of Tommy, Brando\\'s voice and bulldog jowls, and Nino Rota\\'s score. Even the title card\\'s font is memorable. All these things are iconic for a reason - they stand out, while still serving their purpose in the end product.\\n\\n\"Godfather... where is the bathroom?\"\\n\\nAnother sustaining factor of the film\\'s legacy over the past 50 years is its symbolism. Oranges signify impending doom, Michael\\'s facial wounds make him look like his father, a baptism juxtaposed with assassinations - these are elements that have drawn people back again and again, seeking greater depth.\\n\\nBut, as with so many American films, The Godfather also has profound things to say about America; in this case as viewed through the prism of Italian-Americans and, more broadly, criminals who would do anything to achieve the so-called American Dream. The film\\'s opening line is \"I believe in America\" but later, we view a murder that takes place with the Statue of Liberty off in the distance, its back turned on the events. Smarter people than I have written about this theme in great depth, including Lena-Marie Lannutti, Tom Breihan from AV Club, Sterling Farrance, and dozens of academics (seriously, just Google \"The Godfather and The American Dream\").\\n\\nThis is the kind of deep film reading that turns many people off, but it helps preserve the film\\'s legacy, and elevate it to high art. And The Godfather is high art, but it\\'s that rarest of beasts - a film that is both exalted by critics and was a box-office smash (it was the highest-grossing film in US cinemas in 1972).\\n\\nThere\\'s not many other films that can boast that double of critical and popular acclaim, but The Godfather is indeed the kind of the film that seemingly does it all on its way to merging art and entertainment.\\nPosted by DrMattNeal at 04:46\\nEmail This\\nBlogThis!\\nShare to Twitter\\nShare to Facebook\\nShare to Pinterest\\nNo comments:\\nPost a Comment\\nNewer Post\\nOlder Post\\nHome\\nSubscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)\\nThe Greatest Films of All Time\\n\\nAFI\\'s Top 100 films\\n\\nThe Hottest 100 songs that missed triple j\\'s Hottest 100\\n\\nIndiana Jones - From Best To Worst\\n\\nMarvel Cinematic Universe - From Best To Worst\\n\\nChristopher Nolan - From Best To Worst\\n\\nPixar - From Best To Worst\\n\\nBlogalongaBond\\n\\nThe best films of 2019\\n\\nThe best films of 2018\\n\\nThe best films of 2017\\n\\nMy music\\n\\nMy podcast: Can You Believe It?\\n\\nHilarious podcast on the unexplained - SEASON 4 out now!\\nNew anthology out now!\\n\\nVery excited to be part of this book\\nMy radio spot\\nEvery second Thursday from 10.40am chatting film and music with Jonathon Kendall and Jo Printz on ABC Regional Vic.\\nSearch This Blog\\nProudly supported by Warrnambool\\'s #1 cinema:\\nCapitol Cinema, Warrnambool\\nBlog Archive\\n►  2024 (18)\\n►  2023 (36)\\n►  2022 (24)\\n►  2021 (63)\\n▼  2020 (55)\\n►  December (4)\\n►  October (2)\\n►  September (6)\\n►  August (4)\\n►  July (6)\\n►  June (4)\\n►  May (4)\\n▼  April (4)\\nAFI #4: Raging Bull (1980)\\nAFI #3: Casablanca (1942)\\nAFI #2: The Godfather (1972)\\nAFI #1: Citizen Kane (1941)\\n►  March (7)\\n►  February (6)\\n►  January (8)\\n►  2019 (55)\\n►  2018 (78)\\n►  2017 (74)\\n►  2016 (48)\\n►  2015 (49)\\n►  2014 (50)\\n►  2013 (15)\\n►  2012 (17)\\n►  2011 (20)\\n►  2010 (6)\\nMy book\\n\\nThe other great blogs\\nThe Incredible Suit\\nSounds Of The Radio\\nJordan & Eddie\\nComplete Patrick\\nHere I am on Rotten Tomatoes\\nMatt Neal on Rotten Tomatoes\\nCopyright Matt Neal - 2000-2017.

There’s plenty of stuff out there — both feature-length and TV series. And while some of us want more than a movie, just as many of us don’t have the dedication to tackle a full series, especially if it’s already had a season or two. In these cases, trilogies are a wonderful compromise. Here, we provide our Top 10 picks for the best theatrical trios to watch at home right now — ranked in order from great to transcendent, from foreign films to Hollywood classics.\\n10. It could always be worse. Compared to the Wild West, where a trip to the saloon could mean a bullet in the head, a trip to the supermarket is a walk in the park. We definitely have it easier than Clint Eastwood in A Fist Full of Dollars, A Few Dollars More and The Good the Bad and the Ugly. But there’s something thrilling about exploring Sergio Leone’s wide screen, blood soaked world. With its snarling thieves and Eastwood’s “Man With No Name” as enigmatic hero, the otherwise boring towns become exciting backdrops for Mexican standoffs. When Ennio Morricone’s score kicks in and Leone’s editing picks up, our everyday problems fade away like a cowboy riding off into the sunset.\\nL’AVVENTURA (Janus Films)\\n9. Social distancing was just another day at the office for Michelangelo Antonioni. The Italian maestro made a living making films about isolation, and he invented a new cinematic language just so his characters could feel more lonely. In L’Avventura, L’Eclisse and La Notte, wanders Italy in search of love. What she finds, however, are empty streets, abandoned islands and crumbling buildings that reflect her state of mind. While that may sound depressing at a time like this, Antonioni’s non-trilogy demands to be seen under any circumstances, even if the barren landscapes are starting to look more and more like our own.\\nLATE SPRING (New Yorker Films)\\n8. If everyone in the world took the time to watch Late Spring, Early Summer and Tokyo Story, there would be no more wars, negativity or Twitter. There would only be love, life and lots of sake. Yasujiro Ozu’s trilogy, named after a middle class girl struggling to get married (Setsuko Hara), takes a familiar plot and transforms it into something fresh and alive. Through his gift for capturing interior textures (notice the camera’s low angles) and soothing landscapes (a bike ride at the beach is especially freeing), Ozu’s patient gaze lets life unfold before our very eyes.\\nTOY STORY (Disney)\\n7. Being stuck at home with the kids can’t be easy, though it would be a whole lot easier if you put on Toy Story. Who doesn’t love this trilogy? Children laugh at the animated action figures. Parents cry through an adventure that sees Andy grow from a toddler (Toy Story), to summer camp (Toy Story 2), to a teenager packing up for college (Toy Story 3). Whether 9 or 99, Andy, Woody (Tom Hanks) and Buzz (Tim Allen) never fail to pull the heartstrings.\\nTHE GODFATHER (Paramount)\\n6. Here’s an offer you can’t refuse: Watch The Godfather and The Godfather Part 2 if you want to lose yourself in rich set pieces and Shakespearean tragedy. Picking a favorite is impossible. For those who have already witnessed the rise and fall of the Corleone family, which mirrors the trajectory of the American dream, now is as good a time as ever to revisit. For those who have never seen Francis Ford Coppola’s mafia movies: brace yourselves. The haunting tone set by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall is harrowing stuff. As for the third movie? Watch it for closure if you must, but we say leave the gun, the cannoli and The Godfather Part 3 in the trash where they belong.\\nROME, OPEN CITY (Excelsa Films)\\n5. Roberto Rossellini put neo-realism on the map. When he made Rome, Open City in 1945, he forever changed the way we look at movies. By shooting just six months after World War II, he was able to film Italy’s recovery through actual bombed-out buildings, using a mix of professional and non-professional actors for authentic results. The films that followed, City, Paisan and Germany Year Zero, were likewise deeply humanistic stories that are as inspiring now as they were 75 years ago, not least because of the humor. If hope and laughter could get us through a World War, it can get us through an epidemic as well.\\nBEFORE SUNRISE (Columbia Pictures)\\n4. “What was that all about?” Jesse (Ethan Hawk) asks a stranger, Celine (Julie Delpy), about a bickering couple. He doesn’t really care — he just wants to pick up a cute girl on the train. But by the end of Richard Linlater’s trilogy, he knows exactly what that was all about. After the two meet-cute in Vienna (Before Sunrise), and meet again in Paris (Before Sunset), Jesse and Celine end up as a bickering couple in Before Midnight. This final installment is a reminder of how time doesn’t only shape characters on screen. Time can shape the audience as well. Linklater opens his lovers up more and more with each installment, and having spent some of the most romantic scenes in all of cinema in their company (a stroll at dawn in Vienna, Delpy singing “A Waltz for a Night”), the thought of their divorce in Midnight will hit you harder than any of your own breakups.\\nTHE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (Lucas Film)\\n3. Why do we go to the movies? To escape? To learn? To be dazzled? Different people have different answers. But just about everyone finds what they’re looking for in George Lucas’ original trilogy, a swashbuckling adventure through a galaxy far, far away that moves at light speed. A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi never fail to entertain. Whether we are hanging out with Han (Harrison Ford) and Chewie (Peter Mayhew) on the Millennium Falcon or watching Darth Vader (David Prowse) and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) trade lightsaber blows, shrouded by mist on the Death Star, the first three films take us to worlds we couldn’t even dream of, let alone find in any of the sequels or rip-off genre flicks.\\nBLUE (Miramax)\\n2. Instead of light speed, Krzysztof Kieslowski’s trilogy moves at life speed. These ineffably beautiful films — named after the colors/themes of the French flag — are as magical in their eye for details as they are mystical in their understanding of human emotions. It’s as if Kieslowski is playing God: guiding his characters through circumstances entirely out of their control, orchestrating the rhythms of everyday life with the ease of a puppet master. The devil’s in the details, and in the exquisite color schemes that are as vibrant as Zbigniew Preisner’s moody scores. Somehow these three different stories come together in a way that makes sense. As Red connects the dots between Blue and White, we realize that this is a vision of a country going under, and its people trying desperately to stay above water.\\nTHE WORLD OF APU (Sony Pictures Classics)\\n1.“Not seeing the cinema of Satyajit Ray means existing in the world without seeing the sun or moon” Akira Kurosowa (Seven Samurai) famously said in 1975. He was specifically talking about The Apu Trilogy, which tracks the development of its protagonist from childhood (Pather Panchali) to high school (Aparajito) to adulthood (The World of Apu). The cumulative result is a life lived to its fullest, bound by the most touching moments ever caught on film: a brother and sister leaving their rural village to see a train for the first time; Apu teaching his mother about the universe; the river of tears that run down Apu’s face when he rediscovers his calling. Lives, like those trains seen in passing, come and go. The life of Apu, on the other hand, will survive as long as audiences are interested in life-changing art.\\n  SUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\\nFull Name\\nEmail\\n Food + Drink\\n Music\\n Arts\\n Entertainment\\n Events\\n Cannabis\\n Things To Do This Week\\n This Week's Top Stories\\nSEARCH LA WEEKLY\\nlaweekly\\nLAWeekly Instagram: Featuring the culture of LA since 1978 ✌️\\nLoad More...\\nFollow on Instagram\\nPICK US UP\\nCONTACT\\nPOLICIES\\nCOPYRIGHT LA WEEKLY\\nBy continuing to use our site, you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

The movie starts from a trash novel that is generally considered gripping and compulsively readable, though (maybe because movies more than satisfy my appetite for trash) I found it unreadable. You’re told who and what the characters are in a few pungent, punchy sentences, and that’s all they are. You’re briefed on their backgrounds and sex lives in a flashy anecdote or two, and the author moves on, from nugget to nugget. Mario Puzo has a reputation as a good writer, so his potboiler was treated as if it were special, and not in the Irving Wallace-Harold Robbins class, to which, by its itch and hype and juicy roman-à-clef treatment, it plainly belongs. What would this school of fiction do without Porfirio Rubirosa, Judy Garland, James Aubrey, Howard Hughes, and Frank Sinatra? The novel “The Godfather,” financed by Paramount during its writing, features a Sinatra stereotype, and sex and slaughter, and little gobbets of trouble and heartbreak. It’s gripping, maybe, in the same sense that Spiro Agnew’s speeches were a few years back. Francis Ford Coppola, who directed the film, and wrote the script with Puzo, has stayed very close to the book’s greased-lightning sensationalism and yet has made a movie with the spaciousness and strength that popular novels such as Dickens’ used to have. With the slop and sex reduced and the whoremongering guess-who material minimized (“Nino,” who sings with a highball in his hand, has been weeded out), the movie bears little relationship to other adaptations of books of this kind, such as “The Carpetbaggers” and “The Adventurers.” Puzo provided what Coppola needed: a storyteller’s outpouring of incidents and details to choose from, the folklore behind the headlines, heat and immediacy, the richly familiar. And Puzo’s shameless turn-on probably left Coppola looser than if he had been dealing with a better book; he could not have been cramped by worries about how best to convey its style. Puzo, who admits he was out to make money, wrote “below my gifts,” as he puts it, and one must agree. Coppola uses his gifts to reverse the process—to give the public the best a moviemaker can do with this very raw material. Coppola, a young director who has never had a big hit, may have done the movie for money, as he claims—in order to make the pictures he really wants to make, he says—but this picture was made at peak capacity. He has salvaged Puzo’s energy and lent the narrative dignity. Given the circumstances and the rush to complete the film and bring it to market, Coppola has not only done his best but pushed himself farther than he may realize. The movie is on the heroic scale of earlier pictures on broad themes, such as “On the Waterfront,” “From Here to Eternity,” and “The Nun’s Story.” It offers a wide, startlingly vivid view of a Mafia dynasty. The abundance is from the book; the quality of feeling is Coppola’s.\\nThe beginning is set late in the summer of 1945; the film’s roots, however, are in the gangster films of the early thirties. The plot is still about rival gangs murdering each other, but now we see the system of patronage and terror, in which killing is a way of dealing with the competition. We see how the racketeering tribes encroach on each other and why this form of illegal business inevitably erupts in violence. We see the ethnic subculture, based on a split between the men’s conception of their responsibilities—all that they keep dark—and the sunny false Eden in which they try to shelter the women and children. The thirties films indicated some of this, but “The Godfather” gets into it at the primary level, the willingness to be basic and the attempt to understand the basic, to look at it without the usual preconceptions, are what give this picture its epic strength.\\nThe visual scheme is based on the most obvious life-and-death contrasts; the men meet and conduct their business in deep-toned, shuttered rooms, lighted by lamps even in the daytime, and the story moves back and forth between this hidden, nocturnal world and the sunshine that they share with the women and children. The tension is in the meetings in the underworld darkness; one gets the sense that this secret life has its own poetry of fear, more real to the men (and perhaps to the excluded women also) than the sunlight world outside. The dark-and-light contrast is so operatic and so openly symbolic that it perfectly expresses the basic nature of the material. The contrast is integral to the Catholic background of the characters: innocence versus knowledge—knowledge in this sense being the same as guilt. It works as a visual style, because the Goyaesque shadings of dark brown into black in the interiors suggest (no matter how irrationally) an earlier period of history, while the sunny, soft-edge garden scenes have their own calendar-pretty pastness. Nino Rota’s score uses old popular songs to cue the varying moods, and at one climactic point swells in a crescendo that is both Italian opera and pure-forties movie music. There are rash, foolish acts in the movie but no acts of individual bravery. The killing, connived at in the darkness, is the secret horror, and it surfaces in one bloody outburst after another. It surfaces so often that after a while it doesn’t surprise us, and the recognition that the killing is an integral part of business policy takes us a long way from the fantasy outlaws of old movies. These gangsters don’t satisfy our adventurous fantasies of disobeying the law; they’re not defiant, they’re furtive and submissive. They are required to be more obedient than we are; they live by taking orders. There is no one on the screen we can identify with—unless we take a fancy to the pearly teeth of one shark in a pool of sharks.\\nEven when the plot strands go slack, about two-thirds of the way through, and the passage of a few years leaves us in doubt about whether certain actions have been concluded or postponed, the picture doesn’t become softheaded. The direction is tenaciously intelligent. Coppola holds on and pulls it all together. The trash novel is there underneath, but he attempts to draw the patterns out of the particulars. It’s amazing how encompassing the view seems to be—what a sense you get of a broad historical perspective, considering that the span is only from 1945 to the mid-fifties, at which time the Corleone family, already forced by competitive pressures into dealing in narcotics, is moving its base of operations to Las Vegas.\\nThe enormous cast is headed by Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, the “godfather” of a powerful Sicilian-American clan, with James Caan as his hothead son, Sonny, and Al Pacino as the thoughtful, educated son, Michael. Is Brando marvellous? Yes, he is, but then he often is; he was marvellous a few years ago in “Reflections in a Golden Eye,” and he’s shockingly effective as a working-class sadist in a current film, “The Nightcomers,” though the film itself isn’t worth seeing. The role of Don Vito—a patriarch in his early sixties—allows him to release more of the gentleness that was so seductive and unsettling in his braggart roles. Don Vito could be played as a magnificent old warrior, a noble killer, a handsome bull-patriarch, but Brando manages to debanalize him. It’s typical of Brando’s daring that he doesn’t capitalize on his broken-prow profile and the massive, sculptural head that has become the head of Rodin’s Balzac—he doesn’t play for statuesque nobility. The light, cracked voice comes out of a twisted mouth and clenched teeth; he has the battered face of a devious, combative old man, and a pugnacious thrust to his jaw. The rasp in his voice is particularly effective after Don Vito has been wounded; one almost feels that the bullets cracked it, and wishes it hadn’t been cracked before. Brando interiorizes Don Vito’s power, makes him less physically threatening and deeper, hidden within himself.\\nVIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER\\nYou’ll Be Happier: The Story of a Butt Lift\\nBrando’s acting has mellowed in recent years; it is less immediately exciting than it used to be, because there’s not the sudden, violent discharge of emotion. His effects are subtler, less showy, and he gives himself over to the material. He appears to have worked his way beyond the self-parody that was turning him into a comic, and that sometimes left the other performers dangling and laid bare the script. He has not acquired the polish of most famous actors; just the opposite—less mannered as he grows older, he seems to draw directly from life, and from himself. His Don is a primitive sacred monster, and the more powerful because he suggests not the strapping sacred monsters of movies (like Anthony Quinn) but actual ones—those old men who carry never-ending grudges and ancient hatreds inside a frail frame, those monsters who remember minute details of old business deals when they can no longer tie their shoelaces. No one has aged better on camera than Brando; he gradually takes Don Vito to the close of his life, when he moves into the sunshine world, a sleepy monster, near to innocence again. The character is all echoes and shadings, and no noise; his strength is in that armor of quiet. Brando has lent Don Vito some of his own mysterious, courtly reserve: the character is not explained; we simply assent to him and believe that, yes, he could become a king of the underworld. Brando doesn’t dominate the movie, yet he gives the story the legendary presence needed to raise it above gang warfare to archetypal tribal warfare.\\nBrando isn’t the whole show; James Caan is very fine, and so are Robert Duvall and many others in lesser roles. Don Vito’s sons suggest different aspects of Brando—Caan’s Sonny looks like the muscular young Brando but without the redeeming intuitiveness, while as the heir, Michael, Al Pacino comes to resemble him in manner and voice. Pacino creates a quiet, ominous space around himself; his performance—which is marvellous, too, big yet without ostentation—complements Brando’s. Like Brando in this film; Pacino is simple; you don’t catch him acting, yet he manages to change from a small, fresh-faced, darkly handsome college boy into an underworld lord, becoming more intense, smaller, and more isolated at every step. Coppola doesn’t stress the father-and-son links; they are simply there for us to notice when we will. Michael becomes like his father mostly from the inside, but we also get to see how his father’s face was formed (Michael’s mouth gets crooked and his cheeks jowly, like his father’s, after his jaw has been smashed). Pacino has an unusual gift for conveying the divided spirit of a man whose calculations often go against his inclinations. When Michael, warned that at a certain point he must come out shooting, delays, we are left to sense his mixed feelings. As his calculations will always win out, we can see that he will never be at peace. The director levels with almost everybody in the movie. The women’s complicity in their husbands’ activities is kept ambiguous, but it’s naggingly there—you can’t quite ignore it. And Coppola doesn’t make the subsidiary characters lovable; we look at Clemenza (Richard Castellano) as objectively when he is cooking spaghetti as we do when he is garroting a former associate. Many of the actors (and the incidents) carry the resonances of earlier gangster pictures, so that we almost unconsciously place them in the prehistory of this movie. Castellano, with his resemblance to Al Capone and Edward G. Robinson (plus a vagrant streak of Oscar Levant), belongs in this atmosphere; so does Richard Conte (as Barzini), who appeared in many of the predecessors of this movie, including “House of Strangers,” though perhaps Al Lettieri (as Sollozzo) acts too much like a B-picture hood. And perhaps the director goes off key when Sonny is blasted and blood-spattered at a toll booth; the effect is too garish.\\nThe people dress in character and live in character—with just the gewgaws that seem right for them. The period details are there—a satin pillow, a modernistic apartment-house lobby, a child’s pasted-together greeting to Grandpa—but Coppola doesn’t turn the viewer into a guided tourist, told what to see. Nor does he go in for a lot of closeups, which are the simplest tool for fixing a director’s attitude. Diane Keaton (who plays Michael’s girlfriend) is seen casually; her attractiveness isn’t labored. The only character who is held in frame for us to see exactly as the character looking at her sees her is Apollonia (played by Simonetta Stefanelli), whom Michael falls in love with in Sicily. She is fixed by the camera as a ripe erotic image, because that is what she means to him, and Coppola, not having wasted his resources, can do it in a few frames. In general, he tries not to fix the images. In “Sunday Bloody Sunday,” John Schlesinger showed a messy knocked-over ashtray being picked up in closeup, so that there was nothing to perceive in the shot but the significance of the messiness. Coppola, I think, would have kept the camera on the room in which the woman bent over to retrieve the ashtray, and the messiness would have been just one element among many to be observed—perhaps the curve of her body could have told us much more than the actual picking-up motion. “The Godfather” keeps so much in front of us all the time that we’re never bored (though the picture runs just two minutes short of three hours)—we keep taking things in. This is a heritage from Jean Renoir—this uncoercive, “open” approach to the movie frame. Like Renoir, Coppola lets the spectator roam around in the images, lets a movie breathe, and this is extremely difficult in a period film, in which every detail must be carefully planted. But the details never look planted: you’re a few minutes into the movie before you’re fully conscious that it’s set in the past.\\nWhen one considers the different rates at which people read, it’s miraculous that films can ever solve the problem of a pace at which audiences can “read” a film together. A hack director solves the problem of pacing by making only a few points and making those so emphatically that the audience can hardly help getting them (this is why many of the movies from the studio-system days are unspeakably insulting); the tendency of a clever, careless director is to go too fast, assuming that he’s made everything clear when he hasn’t, and leaving the audience behind. When a film has as much novelistic detail as this one, the problem might seem to be almost insuperable. Yet, full as it is, “The Godfather” goes by evenly, so we don’t feel rushed, or restless, either; there’s classic grandeur to the narrative flow. But Coppola’s attitudes are specifically modern—more so than in many films with a more jagged surface. Renoir’s openness is an expression of an almost pagan love of people and landscape; his style is an embrace. Coppola’s openness is a reflection of an exploratory sense of complexity; he doesn’t feel the need to comment on what he shows us, and he doesn’t want to reduce the meanings in a shot by pushing us this way or that. The assumption behind this film is that complexity will engage the audience.\\nThese gangsters like their life style, while we—seeing it from the outside—are appalled. If the movie gangster once did represent, as Robert Warshow suggested in the late forties, “what we want to be and what we are afraid we may become,” if he expressed “that part of the American psyche which rejects the qualities and the demands of modern life, which rejects ‘Americanism’ itself,” that was the attitude of another era. In “The Godfather” we see organized crime as an obscene symbolic extension of free enterprise and government policy, an extension of the worst in America—its feudal ruthlessness. Organized crime is not a rejection of Americanism, it’s what we fear Americanism to be. It’s our nightmare of the American system. When “Americanism” was a form of cheerful bland official optimism, the gangster used to be destroyed at the end of the movie and our feelings resolved. Now the mood of the whole country has darkened, guiltily; nothing is resolved at the end of “The Godfather,” because the family business goes on. Terry Malloy didn’t clean up the docks at the end of “On the Waterfront;” that was a lie. “The Godfather” is popular melodrama, but it expresses a new tragic realism. ♦\\nPublished in the print edition of the March 18, 1972, issue, with the headline “Alchemy.”\\nNew Yorker Favorites\\nThe hottest restaurant in France is an all-you-can-eat buffet.\\nHow to die in good health.\\nWas Machiavelli misunderstood?\\nA heat shield for the most important ice on Earth.\\nA major Black novelist made a remarkable début.

Among recent exegetes, Professor Joseph Albini finds the evidence so conflicting that no single Mafia can be deduced. Like a street-corner rationalist looking for contradictions in the Bible, Albini believes that when two accounts differ they must both be wrong, and that separate names (Cosa Nostra, the Outfit, etc.) must necessarily stand for different things.\\nNicholas Gage finds the fragmented testimony of such canaries as Valachi and Nicola Gentile sufficient to prove the opposite—with a secret society bound to silence, it’s about all the evidence you’re going to get. Gay Talese, who writes like a man on a tapped phone with a gun in his ear, suggests that there may indeed be such a thing but that the American branch consists by now of tired businessmen on the way down. Mario Puzo, as a novelist, has no professional opinion to offer, but knows a good myth when he sees one.\\nContinue reading\\nfor just $1 an issue!\\nChoose a Digital subscription or our best deal—All Access—that includes print and digital issues, full archive access, and the NYR App!\\nView Offers\\nOr register for a free account to read just this article.

It’s strictly business.”\\nFrancis Ford Coppola’s adaptation of Mario Puzo’s bestseller remains the great American epic of the immigrant dream turned family business. Al Pacino stars as Michael Corleone, the clean-cut white sheep and patriotic soldier boy son of New York Godfather Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in an Oscar–winning performance), and this dark side of the American dream story chronicles his rise to ruthless mob leader as modern American businessman. This criminal enterprise is just another side of big business and Michael sets himself to pull his family’s tentacles from the criminal world and into legitimacy.\\nThe Godfather (1972, R) has become the great evocation of the dark side of the American Dream (“I believe in America,” it begins), a (justly) revered cinematic masterpiece and a part of American culture. It’s hard to believe Paramount just wanted a quick exploitation knock-off, at least until Puzo’s novel became a national best-seller. James Caan and John Cazale costar as Michael’s older brothers Sonny and Fredo, Talia Shire his sister, Diane Keaton his fiancée Kay, and Robert Duvall the family consigliere and adopted brother Tom Hagen.\\nThe Godfather: Part II (1974, R), which contrasts Michael’s increasingly ruthless rise with the life of young Vito Corleone (played by Robert De Niro), it’s less a sequel than a further exploration of the family business that reaches back from and looks beyond the story of the first film. Modern mobster Michael has forgotten the old world codes of loyalty and respect and family that guided his father to embrace the calculating ruthlessness of a corporate shark and the flashback structure contrasts Michael’s increasingly ruthless rise with the life of young Vito Corleone (played by Robert De Niro, who won his first Oscar for the role). It’s the role that made Pacino’s career and he shows us every step of Michael’s descent from idealism and loyalty into tyranny and bitterness: the price for his power. Cazale is heartbreaking as the hapless Fredo.\\n\\n\\nBoth films won multiple Oscars, including Best Picture, and Coppola picked up a Best Director award for Part II. Separately the films are masterpieces. Together, they are a landmark work of American cinema.\\nFifteen years later, Coppola returned to the Corleone clan with The Godfather: Part III (1990, R), a somber look at Michael’s efforts to find redemption and pass the torch to the next generation. Andy Garcia, Bridget Fonda, Sofia Coppola, and Joe Mantegna co-star in this final chapter, with George Hamilton taking the Duvall role. The film was a disappointment but Coppola reworked it thirty years later as The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone (1990/2020, R), which somewhat refocuses the film.\\n“Leave the gun. Take the canoli.”\\nThe Godfather placed in the number 12 spot in the 2022 Sight & Sound Greatest Films of All Time poll.\\nParamount+ streams the recently remastered editions of all three films for a limited time:\\nThe Godfather (1972)\\nThe Godfather Part II (1974)\\nThe Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone (1990)\\nAlso on Blu-ray and DVD and on SVOD through Amazon Video (The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, The Godfather Part III), iTunes, GooglePlay and/or other services.

Both sets features commentary by Coppola on all three films, full of illuminating stories about his approach, his actors, how scenes developed, and how he was constantly working under the pressure of hawk-like producers with a different vision of the project, and the beautiful 1991 feature length documentary The Godfather Family: A Look Inside, a combination “making of” and rumination on the Godfather films and one of the best behind the scenes documentaries ever made.\\nAlso features featurettes spotlighting the work of composers Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola and cinematographer Gordon Willis (in a scene excerpted from the documentary Visions of Light), a tour through “Francis Coppola’s Notebook” (his collected prompt-book of thoughts, ideas, and insights that guided him through the scriptwriting and production), “Coppola and Puzo on Screenwriting,” a ten minute featurette about their collaboration, and a faded, scratchy print of the original 1971 9-minute featurette “Godfather: Behind the Scenes.” There’s deleted footage (including some scenes featured in the re-edited 1977 The Godfather Saga mini-series) organized chronologically through the timeline (rather than by film), rehearsal footage, Academy Award acceptance speeches, stills, storyboards, a Godfather timeline and Corleone family tree, cast and crew bios, and all the Godfather trailers you could hope for.\\nExclusive to the new Blu-ray edition are the half-hour “The Masterpiece that Almost Wasn’t” and the restoration overview “Emulsional Rescue.” It’s an offer you can’t refuse.\\n<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />\\nShare this:\\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\\nClick to share on Mastodon (Opens in new window)\\nClick to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\\nClick to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\\nClick to print (Opens in new window)\\nMore\\nLike this:\\nLoading...\\nRelated\\n‘Apocalypse Now: Redux’ – Francis Ford Coppola’s trippy war epic on Netflix\\n11/04/2021\\nIn \"!Featured\"\\n‘Dementia 13’ – Francis Ford Coppola begins on MGM+ and free on Kanopy\\n05/24/2024\\nIn \"!Featured\"\\nAl Pacino and Johnny Depp in ‘Donnie Brasco’ on MGM+\\n03/12/2024\\nIn \"!Featured\"\\nSHARING\\nEmail this article\\nPrint this article\\nTAGS\\n1972, 1974, 1990, Al Pacino, Andy Garcia, Blu-ray, Bridget Fonda, Carmine Coppola, Diane Keaton, DVD, Francis Ford Coppola, George Hamilton, Gordon Willis, James Caan, Joe Mantegna, John Cazale, Mario Puzo, Marlon Brando, Michael Corleone, Nino Rota, Peacock, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall, Sofia Coppola, strictly business, Talia Shire, The Godfather, The Godfather: Part II, The Godfather: Part III, Vito Corleone, VOD\\nPost navigation\\n‘Lady Snowblood’ – vengeance is hers on Max and Criterion Channel\\nPaul Newman is ‘Cool Hand Luke’ on Prime Video\\nSean Axmaker\\nhttps://streamondemandathome.com\\nSean Axmaker is a Seattle film critic and writer.

The Francis Ford Coppola film would go on to win three Oscars at the 45th Academy Awards, including best picture. The Hollywood Reporter’s original review is below.\\nReducing a fat, thick, best-selling novel to manageable screenplay terms has always been a major problem for any filmmaker blessed (or cursed) with the assignment. What do you include? What do you leave out? Perhaps even more important, how do you cast to anticipate the expectations of the millions who have already read the book?\\nThe best answer to these knotty problems would seem to have been provided by producer Albert S. Ruddy on this almost three-hour version of Mario Puzo’s The Godfather. You cut where you can, condense where you can, and cast for excitement rather than any preconceptions of how each character should look. Otherwise, how do you get Marlon Brando for the titular role?\\nRelated Stories\\nMOVIES\\n'Saratoga': THR's 1937 Review\\nMOVIES\\n'The Towering Inferno': THR's 1974 Review\\nBrando, with the first part that he would really sink his teeth into in years, emerges as the hero of this production. Spanning a quarter of a century, the film traces the career of this (forgive me) Mafia capo from the years of his undisputed ascendancy immediately after World War II, when he indignantly refuses to become part of the growing traffic in drugs, to his dignified stepping down late in the ‘50s to make room for his youngest son. In a marvelously inventive and affecting scene, Brando turns from the godfather to grandfather — and dies in the process.\\nNot far behind him is Al Pacino, last seen in Panic in Needle Park, and virtually a double for Dustin Hoffman. As the youthful Michael Corleone, destined to inherit the mantle of the Godfather, he progresses convincingly from a naive, decorated G.I. just returned to the bosom of his family to a nerveless, ruthless killer in sole charge of a domain that comes to include drugs, prostitution, Las Vegas gambling and political fixes. His multifaceted portrayal should catapult him to stardom.\\nBut even though each of the featured roles in The Godfather has been cast to perfection — with veterans like James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley and Richard Conte playing them — the strength of the Mario Puzo-Francis Ford Coppola script is the unbelievable interaction of all these characters as they span the years.\\nWithout undue emphasis, it shows the closeness, the warmth of family ties. The scenes are filled with wives and squalling babies, festive weddings and equally festive funerals, spaghetti prepared in the kitchen … There is the flavor of Italian home life that few gangster films have attempted.\\nAt the same time, there is also a specificity in the persona that few films have dared. Which crooner was separated from whose orchestra on a friendly suggestion from the Godfather? And which movie producer was induced to hire him for a war movie by finding the head of his favorite horse in bed with him one morning? (Here, literary hyperbole may have embellished the facts, but it makes an effective, blood-curdling scene.)\\nDirector Francis Ford Coppola, with a strong assist from cameraman Gordon Willis, has done an extraordinary job of capturing period and place. Very few of the New York exteriors appear to be stock shots; most have been re-created with an incredible attention to detail. Interiors have the rich, burnt-umber look of photographs taken decades ago; while the exteriors — whether representing a garden party in New Jersey or an amorous interlude in Sicily — are drenched with color and sun. A “Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis” billboard in Vegas or “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” on the soundtrack (while a gangster dons his bulletproof vest) also add their own wry grace notes to the passing years.\\nThis is a curious film. One comes to understand, even to condone, the activities of the Godfather and his clan. And even though it frankly portrays the underworld’s influence in the sacrosanct worlds of Hollywood and Las Vegas, there is the feeling that, with young Michael there, these will be better worlds. Essentially, The Godfather is the projection of a myth, not a fact. But it is myths — not facts — that make a fortune. — Arthur Knight, originally published on March 8, 1972\\nPlay War Thunder now for free\\nFight in over 2000 unique and authentic Vehicles.

It has grossed £20 million so far in America, on a production cost of £2i million and Paramount clearly expect it to go on to become the greatest box-office success of all time. The Daily Express and Daily Mail have been running rival serialisations of the book and screenplay; relentless advance publicity on London omnibuses and in Underground stations has blazoned \"The Godfather is coming \"; and the Evening Standard (or was it the Sun?) has instructed us to buy doublebreasted jackets with padded shoulders in homage to an irreversible trend in fashionable gangsterwear.\\nHow can any film live up to such expectations? The Godfather is not a masterpiece. Instead it is a long (three hours), often exciting and always well-directed film about the struggle for survival of one of the five Mafia \\'families,\\' the Corleones, in late 1940s New York. The rules are straightforward, although the conventions are complicated by Sicilian tradition. Absolute authority is wielded by the Don, the head of the family. He dispenses \\' protection \\' in return for favours. In so doing, he builds up a circle of powerful men — politicians, lawyers, police chiefs — who are in his debt. This enables him to provide swifter \\'protection \\' in return for favours extorted as much through terror as moral obligation. And if the \\' family \\' runs short, it forces its kind assistance upon the unwilling, in return for a share in the profits.\\nNaturally all this is fictional and takes place twenty years ago — despite which, a certain powerful organisation of American citizens made sure that the word \\' Mafia \\' wouldn\\'t be mentioned. But in any case, Mario Puzo, author of the novel and partauthor of the screenplay, has whitewashed a very ugly monument of free enterprise. From the very first scene the moral ambiguity of The Godfather becomes apparent. A middle-aged man is pleading into the camera. Tears run down his face. He is telling us that his beautiful virgin daughter was attacked by rapists. Now she is in hospital, scarred for life, and the two boys have got off with three-month prison sentences. Will Don Corleone avenge her?\\nAs he talks, the camera draws back to show that he is addressing the Godfather himself, Marlon Brando, sitting like Solomon in judgement. The Don signfies with a nod that criminal justice will take its course, and the boys will be killed or mutilated in addition to their punishment by the laws of the land. After this first identification of the audience with Don Corleone, we are left in no doubt that he is a figure of immense sympathy. Shrewd in business, tough without being unfair, gentle to children and women, wholly just within the terms of his own world, the Don is acted by Brando with complete conviction. With masterly cunning, we are made aware of a society parallel rather than opposed to the law; a cosa nostra in which the solid virtues of loyalty and honour predominate.\\nThe next \\'godson\\' — bound to the Corleone \\' family \\' by obligation, not blood — is Johnny Fontane, a famous but weakspirited singer who desperately needs a film contract. The producer is browbeaten but adamant, until the Corleones \"make him an offer which he can\\'t refuse.\" He wakes up one morning drenched with blood. Searching down the bed, finding it sodden with blood, he throws off the sheets, to discover the decapitated head of his favourite racehorse. But then — he had been difficult. Scenes intercut with these of a Corleone wedding are much more typical. All is laughter, singing and dancing in the sunlight; and it is here that we are introduced to the film\\'s crowning achievement in the art of appeasing both sides, a hero already enshrined in the American pantheon alongside motherloving Dustin Hoffman in The Graduate, the Don\\'s youngest son, Michael.\\nAs with Brando, half the battle for our sympathy with Michael Corleone is won through the intense conviction Al Pacino brings to the role. At the wedding we see Michael assuring his Anglo-Saxon girlfriend, Kay, that violence and extortion in the \\'family\\' are things of the past. He has no truck with them and anyway no interest in participating in the Corleone rackets. As The Godfather progresses, we are invited to recognise in him a martyr to the family honour, a sacrificial victim of other men\\'s quarrels, anything to justify the scheming low-down crook he finally becomes. The watershed, typically, is Don Corleone\\'s gentlemanly refusal to take the \\' family \\' into the narcotics racket, despite advice from his counsellor who says that it is the coming thing. The narcotics fence, with support from rival Mafia \\'families,\\' puts pressure on the Corleones to subsidise the racket by killing their henchman and pumping five bullets into the Don.\\nMichael Corleone is drawn irresistibly into the gang warfare that folllows, and is hardened by the reprisals taken against his closest family. By degrees his characteristic seriousness is turned away from thoughts of women, politics, the balance of work and pleasure, into plans for making a fast buck and wiping out his enemies. His wife becomes a chattel; and the new Don\\'s deep-seated bitterness will only be eased if he survives to mutter senile endearments at his grandchildren. But that is tomorrow. Today he is the embodiment of a potent American dream: to be shrewd, rich, powerful, good at killing and tender to their mothers — can E20,000,000 of box office receipts be wrong?\\nThe success of The Godfather can\\'t be fully appreciated without understanding that the Mafia plays a strangely beneficient role in American folk-lore. At the same time, whoever has read the book deserves to be reassured that Coppola is a first-rate film director who has greatly improved the work of a second-rate novelist. He wastes nothing, makes every death an individually unpleasant one, and conveys more in a camera angle than Puzo produces in a paragraph. It says a great deal for him that he forced through three of the film\\'s major planning decisions against initial opposition from the Paramount chiefs: the choices of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino to take the parts of the Godfather and Michael, and the decision to take the unit out to Sicily to film the crucial scenes in which Michael Corleone is converted to\\nthe philosophy of the vendetta. But for all Coppola\\'s talent, it has to be stressed that the film is ambiguous to the point of dishonesty about the Mafia. Coppola apparently made one remark during the filming with which many audiences, less easily impressed than their American counterparts by the Mafia lifestyle, may sympathise — that he directed The Godfather so that he could get the capital to make films he really wanted to make.\\n\\nPrevious page\\nNext page\\nWebsite\\nThe Spectator\\nCoffee House\\nThe magazine\\nSpectator Life\\nUseful links\\nContact & FAQs\\nAdvertise with us\\nSponsor an event\\nSubmit a story\\nSubscribe\\nSubscribe now\\nThe Spectator Club\\nNewsletters\\nAbout us\\nAbout The Spectator\\nPrivacy policy\\nTerms of use\\nMore from The Spectator\\nSpectator Australia\\nApollo Magazine\\nThe Spectator Shop\\nSpectator Events\\nThe Spectator, 22 Old Queen Street, London, SW1H 9HP\\nAll articles and content Copyright © 2013 The Spectator (1828) Ltd | All rights reserved\\nSpectator Archive by Netcopy'}, {'ReviewID': 72, 'Critic': 'Skip to main content\\nSearch\\nPapers\\nClippings\\nTopics\\nFree Trial\\nSign in\\nFreeview\\nEnjoy this clipping for free\\nTry 7 Days Free to get access to 979 million+ pages\\nTry 7 Days Free\\nThe Godfather*\\nSave to Ancestry\\nShare\\nView Newspaper\\nSearch the largest online newspaper archive\\nDaily News\\nNew York, New York • \\nThu, Mar 16, 1972\\nPage 422\\nCLIPPED BY\\nRotten_Tomatoes • Mar 29, 2021\\nSearch the largest online newspaper archive\\nTopics to Browse\\nFebruary 27, 1924\\nDecember 19, 1923\\nLizzie Borden\\nFebruary 02, 1924\\nL.

The old irresistible magic is revived in Paramount\\'s \" \"The Godfather\" in his intuitive grasp of Mario Puzo\\'s Don Cor-Ieone, a living symbol of the poetic translation of his name, the lion hearted. Brando is cool as the godfather, sagacious head of the Corleone \"family,\" most powerful of the five \"families\" of organized crime in New York. He is relaxed as the loving, indulgent patriarch of his large blood family, in his mansion behind an iron fence in Long Beach, L.I. And he Is terrifically appealing as the man who cheats death, recovers from bullet wounds inflicted by a rival gang, recuperates at home to enjoy his garden and grandchildren until he dies of old age.\\nOnce he comes out of seclusion, to warn chiefs of the five \"families\" that the gang war must stop. BRANDO IS the strong magnet that will draw fans to \"The Godfather.\" But behind-the-scenes creativity is of equal value to this film of towering proportions. The immensity of the project must have been staggering, but producer Albert S. Ruddy, director Francis Ford Coppola and screenwriter Mario Puzo, with Coppola, make it seem easy. Coppola is first in line for praise.\\nFrom the condensed script, he turns the episodic story into sizable form for the screen a film that moves freely, unhindered by extraneous detail. UNDER COPPOLA\\'S command, seemingly gentle, the players are such heliewibly real human beings, I felt like an eavesdropper, a witness to intimate joys and tragedies. Each performance is a vignette that fits beautifully into the whole exciting picture. Elements of excitement and suspense are sustained in the high peaks of the story gangland strategy, vendettas, violence, revenge, Don Vito Corleone\\'s funeral procession, a long parade of black limousines covered with enough floral arrangements to fill a flower show. And there are happy notes, such as the extravagant lawn wedding r eeption Don Vito gives his daii-rhti\\'r O.nnrV, Mann si firing and Papa the first t: dunce with the bride.\\nPUZO\\'S PIVOTAL charar-t.-r Michael.

ANOTHER CO-STAR. James Caan, contributes a splendid portrayal as Sonny who takes over temporarily, while his father is out of the business. Caan gives a vital portrayal of a hot-headed young man, too quick to act, lacking the discretion that made Don Vito all-powerful, disregarding his fatner s warning in dealing with otiier chiefs, \"Don\\'t tell what you are thinking.\\nLet the others io tne talking.\" He heaus lor trouble his father has avoided.

A tornado of praise—cover stories and huzzahs—blasts out the news that Brando is giving a marvelous performance as Don Corleone in The Godfather, the lapsed Great Actor has regained himself, and so on. As a Brando-watcher for almost 30 years, I’d like to agree.\\nI don’t see how any gifted actor could have done less than Brando does here.\\nBut from his opening line, with his back toward us, Brando betrays that he hasn’t even got the man’s voice under control. (Listen to the word “first.” Pure Brando, not Corleone.) Insecurity and assumption streak the job from then on. They have put padding in his cheeks and dirtied his teeth, he speaks hoarsely and moves stiffly, and these combined mechanics are hailed as great acting. I don’t see how any gifted actor could have done less than Brando does here. His resident power, his sheer innate force, has rarely seemed weaker. His gift of mental transformation, the conviction that the changes are interior and that the externals merely reflect them, is not nearly as strong here as in, say, The Young Lions or Viva Zapata or On the Waterfront or Teahouse of the August Moon. He is handicapped by poor makeup: his hair is not gray enough and his hairline ought to have been altered so that he doesn’t constantly suggest Brando. But the real fault is his own: his laxness, sloth. He has become so lazy in recent years that he is willing to take intent for deed. Corleone has no moments of outburst—the Brando trademark, the leap of flame out of menacing quiet—so his dominance has to come from imagination; muscled by concentration. What Brando manufactures is surface—studied but easy effects.\\nA few moments ring true. When he hears of the death of his son, an ache starts deep in him and works to the surface through the fissures in the old man’s emotional armor. But generally, as they say at the Actors Studio he used to frequent, he gives us mere indication. It’s only the superficial contrast with the “standard” Brando that is making people gasp.\\nCompare Brando’s performance with Jean Gabin in virtually the same role in a recent French film called The Sicilian Clan. What authority Gabin had, how the waters of the world parted before him. If it’s argued that Gabin had a head start by reason of age and temperament, that only proves my point: Brando is being praised because of the difference between him and this role, not because of his achievement in it. The magnificent talent that dozed off some years ago is not fully awakened yet. Like star, like film. The keynote is inflation. Because the picture has so much of the commonplace, it escapes being called commonplace. In no important way is it any better than The Brotherhood (1968), on the same subject. (The word Mafia is never mentioned, but it doesn’t need to be.) The Godfather was made from a big best-seller, a lot of money was spent on it, and it runs over three hours. Therefore it’s significant.\\nWe’re getting the usual flood of comments that the Mafia is only mirror-image corporate capitalism. (All the killings in the film are said to be “business, not personal.”) These high-school analogies ignore, among other things, the origins of the Mafia and its blood-bonds of loyalty, which have nothing to do with capitalism. Almost every one in The Godfather is either a murderer or an accessory, so its moral center depends on inner consistency and on implicit contrast with non-murdering citizens around it. As the picture winds on and on, episode after episode, its only real change is the Mafia’s shift from “nice” gambling and prostitution to take on “dirty” narcotics. (Time, the late 1940s.) Well, I suppose everything’s going to hell, even the morality of the Mafia, but the picture certainly takes a long, long time to get there.\\nAl Pacino, as Brando’s heir, rattles around in a part too demanding for him. James Caan is OK as his older brother. The surprisingly rotten score by Nino Rota contains a quotation from “Manhattan Serenade” as a plane lands in Los Angeles. Francis Ford Coppola, the director and co-adapter (with Mario Puzo), has saved all his limited ingenuity for the shootings and stranglings, which are among the most vicious I can remember on film. The print of the picture showed to the New York press had very washed-out colors.\\nStanley Kauffmann\\nStanley Kauffman was a film critic with The New Republic, beginning in 1958 and continuing until 2013. He was also a professor of English, Drama, and Film at City University of New York from 1973 to 1976, and taught at the Yale School of Drama.\\nRead More: Film, Don Corleone, Jean Gabin, Viva Zapata, Culture, The Godfather, Mario Puzo\\nSponsored Content\\nFROM THE WEB\\nPakistan Solar Panels: See How Much It Will Cost To Install Them (See Prices)\\n(Search Ads)\\nFROM THE WEB\\nIslamabad: You Might Be Surprised By The Price Of Sofas In Mexico\\n(Sofas In Mexico | Search Ads)\\nFROM THE WEB\\nBelly Fat Removal Without Surgery in Pakistan The Price Might Surprise You\\n(Search Ads)\\nFROM THE WEB\\nDiscover the Best Cat Footwear with Yahoo\\n(Yahoo!

A new book, “The Godfather Legacy,” has come out crammed with behind-the-scenes details of a motion picture that author Harlan Lebo calls “that rarest commodity in filmmaking: an overwhelming financial success that is also a creative masterpiece.”\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nWhile the M-word is probably the most overused and abused in the critical lexicon, there can’t be much doubt that “The Godfather” merits the description. Its dark-side-of-the-American-dream story of Michael Corleone’s rise to power as the modern successor to his aging father, Don Vito, emerges gradually from a welter of incident, a thrust and parry of action and reaction, betrayal and revenge that demands to be described as Shakespearean.\\nIt’s not only that this film, like those 16th century dramas, can be watched repeatedly without loss of interest. It’s that “The Godfather” is overflowing with life, rich with all the grand emotions and vital juices of existence, up to and including blood. And its deaths, like that of Hotspur in “Henry IV, Part I,” continue to shock no matter how often we’ve watched them coming.\\nYet though its characters are as out-sized as any of Shakespeare’s nobility, “The Godfather” also benefits by the attention it pays to humanizing detail, to small moments like a little girl dancing on hulking Tessio’s shoes at Connie Corleone’s wedding or its authentic sense of Italian family dining. Excessive but natural, larger than life yet always lifelike, “The Godfather’s” people are grounded in an underlying reality that is completely recognizable.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n*\\nThe collaboration between director and co-writer (with novelist Mario Puzo) Coppola and meticulous cinematographer Gordon Willis expressed a different kind of duality. Both literally and metaphysically, “The Godfather” alternates between darkness and light, between the Don’s funereal study and his daughter’s sun-lit wedding, between the pure love of Michael for his Sicilian bride and the messes his siblings have made of their marriages. And, most famously, in the intercutting between the baptism of Connie’s son (played by baby Sofia Coppola, later notoriously featured in “Godfather III”) and Michael Corleone’s brutal assumption of power.\\nNone of this, of course, would work as well as it did without the exceptional ensemble acting, which extended down to character actors like Richard Castellano as Clemenza, a workaday mobster with a “leave the gun, take the cannoli” attitude. And when it comes to stars like Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton, it’s almost shocking to realize how early in their careers this film caught them, at a time when they were light on their feet and the characters they played had yet to ossify into Mafia cliches.\\nLooming above all these players, even for the long stretches when he’s not on screen, is Marlon Brando as Don Corleone. It’s a commanding performance in every sense, part realistic, part theatrical, filled with showy gestures and real artistry. For every scene that skirts the edge of excess, there are beautiful, almost unnoticed moments, like the magisterial way the Don plays with a kitten while conducting business. And it’s in his foibles, his fondness for fresh fruit and his family, that we come to feel the essential humanity of the man.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nWhile seeing “The Godfather” on the big screen again is to frankly marvel at how undated it remains, reading about it in Lebo’s book, Peter Biskind’s earlier “The Godfather Companion” and the files in the motion picture academy’s Margaret Herrick Library generates wonder of a different sort. How, given the chaos that attended every step of its creation, did this film possibly turn out so well?\\nFor almost every creative decision, even the ones that seem obvious now, was taken in the face of intense opposition by someone. Even the original novel, which ended up on the bestseller list for 67 weeks and sold tens of millions of copies worldwide, was unlikely: Its author, Mario Puzo, had never known a real gangster when he began to write a book that he initially called “Mafia.”\\nStarting the movie train rolling was Peter Bart, now the editor in chief of Variety but in 1967 a key executive working under Paramount head of production Robert Evans. It was Bart who bought Puzo’s novel on the basis of an outline and 100-plus pages of manuscript. Al Ruddy was brought in to produce, though his best-known credit was the TV series “Hogan’s Heroes.” Directors Fred Zinnemann, Richard Brooks, Costa-Gavras and Peter Yates turned the project down, and when it was offered to Francis Ford Coppola, he initially said no as well.\\n*\\nIn his early 30s, Coppola was better known as a screenwriter (a shared Oscar for “Patton”) than as the director of “You’re a Big Boy Now” and “The Rain People.” Wanting independence from Hollywood, he’d started American Zoetrope in San Francisco, but deepening financial troubles made him agree to deal with a book he’d at one time dismissed as “cheap and sensational.”\\nThough it’s impossible to think of the film without him, Puzo and Coppola’s first choice for the Don, Marlon Brando, nearly didn’t get the part. Paramount President Stanley Jaffe was against the idea until, in a situation that has since crept into Hollywood legend, Brando agreed to do a screen test in makeup. Next stop, Sacheen Littlefeather.\\nGiven that the studio had made a fuss about casting unknowns, Variety couldn’t resist a needling headline when the lead role was announced: “No Stars for ‘Godfather’ Cast--Just Someone Named Brando.”\\nFor two other key roles, Coppola turned to actors he’d worked with before--Caan as Sonny Corleone and Duvall as consiglieri Tom Hagen--both of whom had been in “The Rain People.” He also pushed for Al Pacino, then mainly known as a New York stage actor who’d debuted against Patty Duke in “Me, Natalie” and gone on to the little-seen “Panic in Needle Park.”\\nSome of the other casting choices seemed equally eccentric. Gianni Russo, a nonprofessional with an unlimited supply of nerve, talked himself into the role of Connie’s husband, Carlo Rizzi. And Lennie Montana, a professional wrestler who was serving as a bodyguard when producer Ruddy met him, was cast as hit man Luca Brasi. According to Harlan Lebo, Montana “used muscle-tensing tricks learned in his days as a wrestler to make his face purple and his veins swell” in his death scene.\\nJust as interesting were the people who didn’t get parts. Robert De Niro was an unsuccessful candidate for Sonny Corleone and was actually cast as Paulie Gatto, the Don’s bodyguard. If he hadn’t left the picture to take the role Al Pacino vacated in “The Gang That Couldn’t Shoot Straight,” De Niro wouldn’t have been able to play the young Vito Corleone in “Godfather II.”\\nThough Paramount toyed with the idea of shooting the film in Cleveland, Cincinnati, even Kansas City, Manhattan proved to be the inevitable choice, though coping with 120 locations was one of the several stressors on director Coppola. He also had to deal with lobbying from the Italian-American Civil Rights League (which led to the removal of the few uses of “Mafia” and “Cosa Nostra” in the script) and pressures from the studio to keep costs low.\\nRumors were rife that director Elia Kazan, who had worked with Brando with great success, was going to replace him. “He even dreamed,” writes Lebo, “about Kazan coming up to him on the set and taking over the reins--a director’s equivalent of the student nightmare about missing final exams.” Coppola did get help, but it was from Robert Towne, who wrote the key garden scene between Brando and Pacino and was publicly and generously thanked by Coppola when he picked up his screenwriting Oscar.\\nOnce it opened, “The Godfather” became an enormous success, and the public’s will to know focused on all kinds of unlikely areas, including the horse’s head (a real one that was obtained from a rendering plant in New Jersey) that ended up in studio head Jack Woltz’s bed. “There were many people killed in that movie,” the fed-up director was quoted as saying, “but everyone worries about the horse.”\\nBringing everything full circle, the movie “Godfather” led to the publication of stories about the intersection of truth and fiction. Puzo himself, in a book called “The Godfather Papers and Other Confessions,” wrote of an encounter he had in a Los Angeles restaurant with Frank Sinatra, often mentioned as a possible model for the book’s singer Johnny Fontane.\\nSinatra, Puzo wrote, “started to shout abuse. . . . The worst thing he called me was a pimp, which rather flattered me. But what hurt was that there he was, a northern Italian, threatening me, a southern Italian, with physical violence. That was roughly equivalent to Einstein pulling a knife on Al Capone.”\\nMore to Read\\nReview: A rowdy Irish rap trio with a growing sense of purpose tells its own story in ‘Kneecap’\\nAug. 2, 2024\\nSandy Bresler, Jack Nicholson’s longtime agent and agency co-founder, dies at 87\\nAug. 2, 2024\\nReview: In the awkward ‘Harold and the Purple Crayon,’ a toddler is now a childlike adult\\nAug. 2, 2024\\nMOVIES\\nNewsletter\\nOnly good movies\\nGet the Indie Focus newsletter, Mark Olsen's weekly guide to the world of cinema.\\nEnter email address\\nSIGN ME UP\\nYou may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.\\nKenneth Turan\\nX\\nKenneth Turan is the former film critic for the Los Angeles Times.\\nMore From the Los Angeles Times\\nMOVIES\\nReview: A gay writer gets risky to supercharge his stalled literary career in ‘Sebastian’\\nAug. 2, 2024\\nMOVIES\\nReview: Matt Damon and Casey Affleck play half-smart criminals in overfamiliar ‘The Instigators’\\nAug. 2, 2024\\nMOVIES\\nTom Cruise reportedly to end Paris Olympics with epic stunt to pass the torch to L.A.\\nAug. 2, 2024\\nMOVIES\\nMaking a ‘biopic in real time’ with the Irish-language rappers of ‘Kneecap’\\nAug. 1, 2024\\nSubscribers are Reading\\nCOVID surging in California.

For the sake of surprise, we’ll wait to reveal where this and every other film ranks on the list until the very end. We hope you enjoy.\\n…\\nFew people could have anticipated during the course of adapting Mario Puzo’s best-seller The Godfather to the big screen that it would become a lasting legacy in cinema. Forty-plus years have passed since its theatrical release, yet it stands the test of time as not only one of the greatest depictions of a crime family, but as one of the best films ever made.\\nThe audience is introduced to the Corleone family during the wedding of patriarch Vito’s only daughter. We learn something about the family members as each vignette coalesces into a portrait of organized crime. Francis Ford Coppola chronicles the ins-and-outs of the organized crime business, from Vito’s fair-handed rule over his territory to Michael’s cruel, calculating and lasting reign over New York City and eventually Nevada. When Vito bare survives an attempt on his life, the family quickly seeks to fill the power vacuum left by his absence.\\nThe image above, in which Michael first hears of his father’s attempted murder, captures the beginning of his moral descent. He answers the phone a war hero reluctant to take part of the Corleone dynasty, but he hangs up the de facto clan leader, launching a campaign of bloody revenge. Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale) both vie for the title of Don, but Michael (Al Pacino) is the one who avenges his father killing Sollozo and Cpt McCluskey before fleeing to Sicily. Sonny takes over, but Michael’s absence does not last long. Sonny’s time as Don is quickly ended in a hail of gunfire, and Fredo is too simple-minded to hold any real power. Michael Corleone thought he could take over the family business without losing his soul, but he was wrong.\\nWhen writing about The Godfather it’s impossible to ignore its subsequent sequel, which could have coasted off of its predecessor, but instead enriches everything that came before. The Godfather Part II delves into the background of Vito’s rise to power, establishing the foundations of the family’s bribery, theft, corruption and murder. Meanwhile, Michael Corleone is a shell of his former self.\\nThe film spans decades between young Vito (Robert DeNiro) climbing the socio-economic ladder of New York City and Michael seeking a way to legitimize the family in Nevada. As each move is made to push the Corleone name into the neon-lit streets of Las Vegas, Michael is stymied at every turn by Miami boss Hyman Roth. Later on, we learn of an intimate betrayal that seals Michael’s spiral into evil and cements Part II as an equal successor to Coppola’s original.\\nAny question of whether these two films romanticize gangsterism is put to rest with the subtlety of a gun shot to the head. Michael’s choices at the end of the film are haunting in their cold-blooded rationale. Paranoia has eaten away the humanity that made him so reluctant to come back home in The Godfather. Vito dies with regret in that tomato patch playing with his grandson, but no tears are shed for Michael in his complex at Lake Tahoe. His “business transactions” left him without a brother, and his rage drove away his wife and children.\\nFew images captured on celluloid are quite as horrifying as the look on Michael’s face as Kay (Diane Keaton) explains what happened to her third pregnancy. His expression of conviction, anger, and potential combustion perfectly summarizes Al Pacino’s layered portrayal of the most complicated mobster put to film. It may be hard to watch, but it’s undoubtedly one of the biggest reasons the Godfather saga has such lasting impact.\\nDuring the depression, America fell in love with gangsters, the fast cars they drove and the gorgeous women draped over their arms. Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo destroyed that romantic glow gangster films had with each car-bomb, shooting, stabbing and heinous crime committed. Moviegoers rooted for villains like James Cagney in White Heat and Angels with Dirty Faces, but Al Pacino’s performance as Michael Corleone goes far darker places. His gangster doesn’t inspire cheers, it shakes viewers to their core.\\nCoppola doesn’t waste a single frame of celluloid in telling the story of the Corleone family. Every scene illuminates the motivations behind each character and dilemma within the family and all the people that surround it. Audiences don’t identify with the Corleones because they are good people – they clearly aren’t. The draw is in sitting with them around the dinner table as they plot. We’re with them through it all, and if there’s anything this family demands, it’s our respect and loyalty.\\nWhat truly marks The Godfather and The Godfather Part II as immortal classics is the following they have built over 40 years. This series doesn’t just have fans, it has inspired dialogue that has infiltrated the global lexicon. Entire philosophies have been derived from the many quotable lines in the picture–I’ve even had people tell me that everything important in life can be taught by the film.\\n“Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.”\\n“A man who doesn’t spend time with his family can never be a real man.”\\n“Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgement.”\\nThe Godfather sits at #3 on AFI’s 100 Greatest American Movies of All Time, and both films reside near the top of IMDb’s Top 250 Films.  That lasting popularity isn’t a fluke; the Godfather films stand the test of time because these aren’t just movies, they’re cultural touchstones.\\nTags\\n0\\nSHARES\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nRELATED POSTS\\n4\\nHistory of Film: “Psycho”\\n10 years ago\\n1\\nHistory of Film: “Lawrence of Arabia”\\n10 years ago\\n5\\nHistory of Film: “2001: A Space Odyssey”\\n10 years ago\\n4 thoughts on “History of Film: ‘The Godfather’ and ‘The Godfather Part II’”\\nSteven Flores\\non December 17, 2013 at 2:28 PM said:\\n“I was stepped over Mike!

To permit us a glimpse at The Mob, with all of its ethnic insularity, is like giving a chronic gambler a chance to wander above the false mirrors that overlook every casino. The subject matter dominates any single performance.

One eventually becomes acclimated to it, and the familiarity allows one to marvel at his physical mannerisms.\\nJowls sagging, hair thinning, and hands conducting unheard music, Brando\\'s Don Vito Corleone is an old fighter making it on instinct. Dressed in baggy, pleated pants and flannel shirts buttoned to the top, he resembles a sack of potatoes always in danger of falling apart. More important is that Mario Puzo\\'s novel has been well served by coscenarist and director Francis Ford Coppola. The bullets and garrotings are all there, but the movie is much more than The Untouchables told from the point of view of The Mob. \"The Godfather\" according to Coppola, is, first and foremost, a story of family.\\nOf a family that will employ inlaws, but never give them power. A family that will honor in-laws, but kill them for betraying blood relatives. Blood is thicker than anything else in \"The Godfather.\" For those who haven\\'t read the book, the story covers a decade 1945-55 of Mafia gang wars and the transference of power within one family from father to son. It was a decade of enormous growth for the Mafia: from numbers to narcotics, from the East to Las Vegas. After much deliberation and expense, the film\\' was made as a period piece, and Coppola\\'s attention to detail gives the opening wedding scene, for example, the look of a documentary.\\nWhat is particularly surprising,, given the alleged intimidation of the script by The Mob, is that the dark side of Sicilian clans\\' insularity is given as much attention as its more romantic elements. When The Mob gathers to argue over how the burgeoning narcotics industry will be regulated, one family chief demands that sales be directed to blacks. \"They are animals anyway,\" he says. The central dictum of allegiance to family is communicated beautifully by Coppola thru his emphasis on two non-Sicil- 49 I I f s J - y f, .- -; kr - - \" J I \\' \\'- XA-V xsV.s Jtm Al Pacino foreground as Michael Corleone. ian characters: the adopted Irish son of Don Corleone and the WASP girl friend of the Don\\'s favorite son.\\nWhen innocent Kay Adams learns that her boy friend\\'s father has been known to have a pistol speak for him, her lips open in the mixture of shock and curiosity that typifies the general attitude toward organized crime. Toward the middle of the film she is reluctantly allowed to enter the home of the Corleones, and, at the end, the door that closes in the audience\\'s face closes on her as well. The most favorable notices for acting have been dominated by Brando and Al Pacino, who plays the young son with a future. However, I was most impressed by the performance of Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, the adopted son and counselor to Brando. Duvall was employed with similar success once before by Coppola in \"The Rain People.\" The character of Tom Hagen, because of Duvall\\'s quietly compelling performance and because he is a non-Sicilian, becomes the touchstone for the moral point of the film.\\nHis ready compliance with any assignment again indicates that the life of crime has a narcotic effect on those who practice it.

That is the way the movie has been programmed and promoted: Brando, Brando, Brando, and more Brando. The word from advance hush-hush screenings was wow all caps and exclamation point. More exclamation, in fact, than explanation. More than one whisperer intimated that Brando’s make-up (by Dick Smith, the auteur also of Dustin Hoffman’s Shangri-La face-furrows in “Little Big Man”) was so masterful that the Brando we all know and love had disappeared completely beneath it. I must admit that some of the advance hype had gotten to me by the time I sat braced in my seat for the screening of “The Godfather.” I was determined to discern Brando beneath any disguise mere humans could devise.\\n]\\nThe picture opened with a face outlined against a splotched blue background with no spatial frame of reference, a background notes much abstract as optically mod with a slow zoom to take us into the milieu by degrees. But that face! I was stunned. How had Brando managed it? The eyes, the ears, the nose, the chin. It didn’t look anything at all like Brando. And the voice was equally shattering in it unfamiliar pitch. I began groping for adjectives like “eerie” and “unearthly.” Gradually the face began to recede into the background, and I heard a familiarly high-pitched voice somewhere in the foreground. I suddenly recalled the plot of the novel and thus I realized that the face looming in front of me did not resemble Brando’s simply because it wasn’t Brando’s. (I learned later that the face and voice in question for the role of Bonasera belonged to a 20th-billed actor named Salvatore Corsitto who gets no points for looking like himself.)\\nWhen Brando himself finally materialized on the screen as Don Vito Corleone, I could see it was Brando all the way. There was no mistaking the voice even with the slow-motion throaty whine Brando used to disguise it. Brando’s range has always been more limited by his voice than his Faustian admirers cared to admit. That is why his best roles have always played against the voice by negating it as a mechanism of direct communication. Brando’s greatest moments are thus always out of vocal psych with other performers. Even the famous taxicab scene with Rod Steiger in “On the Waterfront” operates vocally (though not physically or emotionally) as a syncopated Brando soliloquy, a riff on the upper registers of sensitivity and vulnerability resonating all the more in counterpoint to Steiger’s more evenly cadenced street glibness and shrillness. Curiously, Brando has come to embody, often brilliantly, a culturally fashionable mistrust of language as an end in itself. The very mystique of Method Acting presumes the existence of an emotional substratum swirling with fear and suspicion under every line of dialogue. Hence, it is surprising that Brando has not played gangsters more often. The Machiavellian bias of the Method is ideally suited to the ritualized conversations of organized criminals.\\nSo to answer belatedly the first question everyone asks about “The Godfather”: Brando gives an excellent performance as Don Vito Corleone, a role Lee J. Cobb could have played in his sleep without any special make-up. Brando’s triumph and fascination is less that of an actor of parts than of a star galaxy of myths. Which is to say that he does not so much lose himself in his part as left his part to his own exalted level as a star personality. The fact remains, however, that though Brando’s star presence dominates every scene in which he appears, the part itself is relatively small, and there are other people who are equally good with considerably less strain, among them the extraordinarily versatile James Caan as the hot-headed, ill-fated Sonny Corleone, Richard Castellano as the jovially gruesome Clemenza, and Robert Duvall as Don Vito Corleone’s non-Italian consigliere, Tom Hagen. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone has much the biggest and most challenging role in the film, and gives the most problematical performance. It is with Pacino’s role that fact and fantasy come most discordantly into conflict. And it is with the characterization of Michael Corleone that both director-scenarist Francis Ford Coppola and novelist-scenarist Mario Puzo seem to drift away from the rigor of the crime genre into the lassitude of an intellectual’s daydream about revenge without remorse and power without accountability.\\nThere were many ways to adapt Puzo’s novel to the screen. (There is no question here of fidelity to a text that was merely the first draft of a screen treatment.) Puzo quotes Balzac no less in a foreword conveying a Brechtian implication: “Behind every great fortune there is a crime.” Brando claims to have been representing a typically corporate personality from the ruthlessly American capitalistic system. But “The Godfather” as a whole does not sustain this particular interpretation as effectively as did Kurosawa’s “The Bad Sleep Well” some years ago. That is to say that Kurosawa and his scenarists came much closer to conjuring up the quasi-criminal ruthlessness of a conglomerate like ITT than do Coppola, Puzo, and Brando. Coppola’s approach tends to be humanistic, ethnic, and almost grotesquely nostalgic. There is more feeling in the film than we had any right to expect, but also more fuzziness in the development of the narrative. “The Godfather” happens to be one of this movies that can’t stay put on the screen. There are strange ghosts everywhere like Richard Conte’s authentically Italian gangster kingpin Barzini evoking memories of “House of Strangers” and “The Brothers Rico,” and Al Martino as Johnny Fontane (alias Frank Sinatra) reportedly walking off the stage of a New York supper club just before “The Godfather” opened and apparently disappearing into that thick mist of forbidden fictions.\\n[Each weekday morning, we post an excerpt from another issue of the Voice, going in order from our oldest archives.

The film is based upon the novel by Mario Puzo (who co-wrote the screenplay) and many sub-plots were minimised or thrown away by director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola, himself an Italian American and family man. He knew that the only way to make Puzo’s sprawling novel work on screen was to focus on the familial relationships within this crime story, whether it be father to son, brother to brother, or husband to wife. In this world blood is not only thicker than water, it is holy.\\nCoppola opens the films with an interesting shot of a pitch black screen giving way to a desperate figure, an undertaker pleading to Mafioso patriarch Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) to revenge the savage beating of his daughter. It is the wedding day of the lone Corleone daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request,  which Don Vito takes on with reason, while also subtlety enforcing his position as a man to be respected and feared.\\nBrando’s casting was a coup for Coppola, for three reasons. First, it exhibited the brilliance and innovation of Brando’s thespian prowess, creating a wholly new mafia figure within a world of stereotype. Second, it re-established Brando’s standing as a major player after years of being labelled “box-office poison”. And third, it points to Brando’s influence as “godfather” to a generation of actors, many which play his children in this film.\\nPlot wise, The Godfather begins with the attempted assassination of Don Vito from a rival crime family unhappy with his refusal to enter the narcotics trade. With the Don temporarily out of the picture, it is up to his sons to run the Corleone clan. There is hot tempered Sonny (James Caan), meek mild Fredo (John Cazale), adopted son of Irish ancestry Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and the fiercely independent Michael (Al Pacino).\\nIt would be Michael who comes through as successor, and as a result The Godfather is as much Pacino’s film as it is Brando’s, introducing himself with a revelation of a performance.\\nPacino was at first in the firing line from studio heads at Paramount for what they felt was miscasting on Coppola’s part. Their minds were swiftly changed after viewing a pivotal point in the movie known as “the Sollozzo scene”, which displayed Michael’s true murderous, Machiavellian nature in his disposal of his father’s would be killer and corrupt police official.\\nThis is followed by Michael’s self exile to Sicily, which sells the romantic nature of The Godfather, with the visuals of lush country side Italy coupled with Nino Rota’s hypnotically melodic score.\\nYet there is a darkness which protrudes form this romance. This is a film about the mafia after all, and death at its most sinister and intimate is featured throughout.\\nThus underlines the tragedy of The Godfather, with the sins of the father bestowed upon his children, who if not met by deaths hand will be plunged into hellfire for their actions, especially that of Michael’s. Coppola expertly stages this fact in a sequence which features the death of the Corleone’s enemies, while Michael stands as spiritual godfather to his sister’s child within a Catholic church.  \\nIn the end Michael and his family stand tall, yet there is a void in their victory. Coppola has not only made the greatest crime movie of all time, he has also portrayed how the Mafioso policy of “an eye for an eye” has delivered this family unto eternal darkness.\\n*****\\n    RELATED CONTENT  \\nCarlito's Way\\nfilm review\\nTop Ten\\nGangster Movies\\nApocalypse Now\\nfilm review\\n      Created and Edited by Matthew Pejkovic / Contact: mattsm@mattsmoviereviews.net\\nLogo created by Colony Graphic Design / Copyright © Matthew Pejkovic\\n\\n\\n   \"}, {'ReviewID': 82, 'Critic': 'EMANUEL LEVY\\nHOME\\nLEVY UNFILTERED\\nREVIEWS\\nNEWS\\nOSCAR\\nCOMMENT\\nTRAILERS\\nINTERVIEWS\\nFESTIVAL\\nLEVY BIO\\nPOP CULTURE\\nGodfather, The (1972): Coppola’s Best Picture Oscar, Highlight of American Cinema, Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino\\nFebruary 14, 2009 by EmanuelLevy\\nThe phenomenal critical and commercial success of Bonnie and Clyde in 1967 revived Hollywood’s and the American public’s interest in the crime-gangster movies.\\nGrade: A (***** out of *****)\\nMore crime films were Oscar-nominated in the 1970s than in any previous decade. Moreover, three features won the Best Picture Oscar: the action-thriller “The French Connection,” in 1971, and the two Francis Ford Coppola crime sagas, “The Godfather” in 1972, and “The Godfather, Part Two,” in 1974.  In 1990, the third and last segment, “The Godfather, Part Three,” also secured Best Picture nomination.\\n          Of the first two “The Godfather” movies, the first was more critically acclaimed and more popular at the box-office, grossing over $80 million in domestic rentals. But it was less honored by the Academy, winning a second Best Actor for Marlon Brando, as Mafia boss Don Vito Corleone, and screenplay, written by Coppola in collaboration with Mario Puzo, upon whose best-seller it was based.\\nA highlight of the American Cinema of the 1970s, The Godfather is a seminal film which is successful as mass entertainment as well as a more serious art films, a desirable combination that only a few Hollywood movies have achieved, past or present.\\nMario Puzo claims that he had Marlon Brando in mind as Don Vito Corleone while he was writing The Godfather. He sold the rights to Paramount before the book was published for $35,000, and a promise that he would also write, or collaborate on the script for a fee of $100,000 and  percentage on the film’s grosses.\\nAt first, Paramount was not enthusiastic about The Godfather; the studio had recently lost money on The Brotherhood, a Kirk Douglas Mafia movie. They therefore instructed Puzo to write a contemporary crime story. The studio then allocated a modest $2 million budget and hired Al Ruddy as producer and Francis Ford Coppola as director, both young (in early thirties) and inexperienced.\\nRuddy had been involved in TV and some minor films, and Coppola had directed You’re a Big Boy Now, Finian’s Rainbow, and The Rain People, none of which was a commercial or critical success. But Coppola was respected as a writer, having won an Oscar as co-scripter of Patton, which won the 1970s Best Picture Oscar.\\nCoppola persuaded Paramount to invest more money in The Godfather, after the huge appeal of Puzo’s book, which had sold half a million copies in hardback and 10 million copies in paperback.  At the end, the budget amounted to $6 million.\\nMarlon Brando rendered one of his most arresting performances, as Don Corleone, a tough old Sicilian peasant who has risen to the level of omnipotent chieftain in an empire of Italian-American crime.  The leader of one of the five families that control the Mafia in New York, he is also a family man–his sons and relatives are members of his operation and he expects total loyalty from them.\\nOne of the fascinating contradictions of The Godfather is that although it is a story of crime, replete with violence and brutal killings, it is essentially a saga of a warm family adhering to its own moral codes, based on love and concern for each member.\\nThe Corleones are a close-knit family, headed by Don Corleone as its undisputed patriarch; as played by Brando, he carries the authority and charisma of a religious leader. His voice is quiet and rasping, his chin sticks out, and men kiss his hand while seeking favors. But there is also remoteness and detachment–his watchful eyes reflect commanding and authority.\\nOpening Sequence: Wedding\\n          The opening shot of The Godfather sets the dark tone of the film, both thematically and visually.  The look is muted and dim, while Don Corleone listens to the undertaker Bonasera (Salvatore Cirsitto), asks for help. Though his daughter was brutally raped by two non-Italians, the men have been pardoned by a judge, and Bonasera now pleads for justice. Listening without showing any overt emotion and stroking his white cat, Corleone reminds Bonasera of his previous lack of respect. Even so, But Bonasera is touching and the Don promises to “deal with” the rapists,” expecting the undertaker to return the favor one day.\\nThe Don and his sons then go about the business of the day, attending the marriage of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire) to the bookmaker Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo). The Corleone mansion and the gardens are full of guests enjoying a lavish banquet and dancing to an Italian band.\\nIt’s August 1945 and the Don’s youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino) has just returned home from WWII service, wearing the decorated uniform of a marine captain.  Michael is accompanied by his WASPish girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton). College-educated and mild-mannered, Michael is his father’s hope that he will rise to legitimate prominence in politics.\\nThe wedding party is enlivened by the arrival of the popular crooner, Johnny Fontane (Al Martino), who sings a love song for the newlyweds.  The mood changes when he asks Don Corleone for a favor, wishing to get an important part in a Hollywood film. The part will lift his career, but the producer has refused to cast him. The Don sends his right-hand man, legal adviser and adopted son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), to negotiate with producer Jack Woltz (John Marley), who still refused to consider Fontane. The next morning Woltz wakes up to find the severed head of his horse in his bed. Fontane gets the film.\\nHagen arranges for a meeting in NY between Don Corleone and Virgil Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) of the Tattaglia family. Sollozzo offers the Don to join him in a new, promising avenue, narcotics in America. Don Corleone flatly refuses to partake of a crime he believes to be bad and dangerous. However, his son, Sonny (James Caan), is not as morally scrupulous. Weeks later, Don Corloene is gunned down in the streets, as a way of eliminating him in order to do business with his son. The old man survives and when he recovers, Michael, previously uninvolved, decides to follow the family trade. He agrees to meet Sollozzo and a crooked police captain, McClusky (Sterling Hayden). But instead of making a deal, he kills the pair.\\n          For his safety, the family sends him to Sicily, where he lives for two years and marries a local girl, Appollonia (Simonette Stefanelli). The idyll is ended when his wife is killed in a car explosion, a reprisal engineered by a bodyguard. Michael returns to New York, fully committed to a career in the underworld.\\nThe rival families compete for the control of the criminal enterprises of New York and its environs. The aging Don meets with his rivals and states his position on cooperation. They seemingly agree, but it’s a false front and they continue to manipulate the business. Sonny is trapped and shot to death, forcing Michael to assume command of his family. He marries former  girlfriend Kay, and settles down to a life similar to that of his father. Don Corleone, playing with a grandson in the garden, is stricken with a heart attack and dies.\\nOnce Michael Corleone becomes the new Godfather, he shows that he is tougher and more ruthless than his father.  With precise planning, he arranges the elimination of all his enemies who have harmed his family, all his opposition.\\nClosting Sequence: Baptism\\nThe Godfather ends with a striking montage of multiple slaughter, cutting back and forth from a baptism service in a church, attended by Michael, and the various locations in which his men kill his rivals. The murders restore the Corleones to supreme leadership in the underworld, cementing the position of  Michael as the most powerful chief in American crime.\\nAn epic film boasting a running close to three hours (175 minutes to be exact), the appeal of The Godfather derives from its intricate storytelling involving characters, bloody violence, and affectionate portrayal of family relationships.\\nCoppola set out to redeem his faltering directing career, having made of three minor and mediocre films.  As a result of his ambition, burgeoning talent, and luck,  he was able to cast major American actors of the decade, such as Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Diane Keaton, and James Caan, and to blend them effectively with great character actors, such as John Marley, Al Leitteri, Sterling Hayden, Richard Conte, and Richard Castellano.\\nCommercial Hit\\nWithin weeks of initial release, it became a blockbuster–one of the most profitable films ever made. It recouped it 6 million budget within a matter of weeks. By the end of 1972, The Godfather has grossed more than $100 million\\nMovie critics were uniform in praising the film for its resonant narrative, visual style, magnificent composition, flawless acting, and brilliant direction.  But they wondered: How could they, as critics and gatekeepers, and the public, be so entertained by a film about the politics of organized crime?\\nFor their part, the filmmakers claimed in response that it is not a documentary or condemnation of the Mafia, but a fictional story about people in a certain section of society.\\nThe movie was a curious, but successful mix of creative fantasy and disguised facts, made even more bizarre by the well-publicized facts that dozens of hoodlums died in internecine warfare in New York, while the film was being made. The picture supported the familiar claim of the underworld, “We only kill each other,” which regrettably happens to be far from the truth.\\nThe Mafia seemed to enjoy The Godfather as much as the general public, which alarmed some sociologists concerned about the moral impact of the film. Initially it was the Italian-American groups in New York who were most opposed to the film.  Members of the underworld made known to Paramount that if the company expected to be able to shoot the film in New York, they would make it impossible unless the words “Mafia” and “Cosa Nostra” were not used in the screenplay.\\nThe Italian-American Civil Rights League staged a rally in Madison Square Garden and raised $600,000 for the purpose of stopping the film. Interestingly, Frank Sinatra was a member of that movement, though the role of Johnny Fontane is widely believed to be patterned on his career.\\nSays producer Al Ruddy, “We had to get the word out to the Italian-American community in a very bona fide way that we had no intention of doing a schlock exploitation gangster film.” Ruddy met with prominent citizens and convinced them of his purpose, and in making the picture he received very little hindrance and considerable help.\\nThe scene of Brando being gunned down in the street took three days to film the sequence. Dozens of other locations were used in Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn and Richmond, where a side street in a residential area of Staten Island was used as the Corleone Family Mall. The location was further isolated by building an eight-foot wall around the garden of the house that was leased as the home of the family.\\nThe interiors of the home were shot at the Filmways Studio in the Bronx, and the producers secured permission to film scenes in Bellevue Hospital and the New York Eye and Ear Clinic. In addition to the New York locations, which account for the bulk of the film, the company spent two weeks on location in a small village in Sicily.\\nThe Godfather offers a dark commentary on certain aspects–business world–of American life. He feels that it might even be taken as an allegory on corporate thinking, and that don Corleone is a somewhat perverse manifestation of the American Dream.  He told Newsweek: “In a way the Mafia is the best example of capitalists we have. Don Corleone is just an ordinary business magnate who is trying to do the best he can for the group he represents and for his family… unlike some corporate heads, Corleone has an unwavering loyalty for the people that have given support to him and his causes and he takes care of his own.”\\nBold and frank, Brando stated that he didn’t see much difference between the tactics of the Mafia and the American government, which brought him criticism. The Wall Street Journal pointed out that there must be a difference between the Cosa Nostra and Gulf and Western, who own Paramount, and a difference between machine-gunning or garroting someone, and hiring a detective to trail him.\\nIf The Godfather is a glorification of free enterprise gone mad, the film also offers evidence that capitalism still works.  The movie suggested (explicitly to some, implicitly to others) that the career of a gangster is not that different from that of a legit businessman or mainstream politician.\\nOne of Coppola’s major accomplishments is to offer a seemingly contradictory perspective, both an inside and outside look of the Corleone family and its dynamics of operation.  The inside, largely sympathetic view showed the love, respect and warmth of most of the family relations among credibly constructed individual characters, grounded in a particular socio-historical reality.  On the other hand, the outside look offered a critical analysis of a criminal clan, motivated by dubious ethics and the use of illegitimate means (bloody violence) to achieve and maintain its dominance.\\nThis kind of ambiguous morality and duality in perspective struck a chord in the early to mid seventies due to the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal; President Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, the same year that The Godfather, Part Two was released.\\nOscar Context\\n                  The film’s major competitor in 1972 was Bob Fosse’s exuberant musical “Cabaret,” which captured the largest number of awards, 8, including Best Director. The two Godfathers broke new grounds in several ways. For years, until “The Departed,” in 2006, they were the only crime-gangster movies to have won Best Picture. “The Godfather Part II,” won the largest number of awards, 6, thus becoming the only sequel to have received an Oscar.\\nCredits\\nAn Albert S.

It has never looked or sounded better. Even aficionados who think they know this great film and its two sequels well may be surprised at the impact of the new version. Coppola, 32, was at his peak when he made \"The Godfather.\" And the rogue\\'s gallery he assembled, Brando and his scinillating young support crew James Caan, John Cazale and Al Pacino as Corleone sons Sanino (or \"Sonny\"), Fredo and Michael; Robert Duvall as adopted son and lawyer/consigliere Tom Hagen; Diane Keaton as Michael\\'s fiancee, Kay Adams - create a subtly electric interplay, an artistic esprit de corps that still seems inique. So does the movie\\'s dark story.\\nAdapted from Puzo\\'s 1969 best seller, it chronicles the postwar decline of Don Vito Corleone and the rise of the new don: his war hero son, Michael. Played by Pacino (at 31, only a year younger than Coppola), Michael is a quiet, brooding intellectual who initially eschews the family business. (\"That\\'s my family, Kay. It\\'s not me.\") But he\\'s pulled into the fray when a vicious gang war erupts over the introluction of the new heroin industry by tough, saturnine newcomer Virgil \"The Turk\" Sollozzo (Al Lettieri). Michael is torn by two powerful codes, his own sense of morality and his love of family.\\nBut by the end of the film, he has become what his father was: a man who murders and terrorizes when necessary, thriving in a criminal underworld on profits from society\\'s vices (gambling, prostitution, corrupt politicians and unions and, ultimately, that same narcotics trade of which Don Vito irst disapproved). All this is framed by two Corleone family celebrations: the buoyant sunlit wedding of Connie Corleone (Talia Shire, Coppola\\'s sister) and Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo) in the beginning, and, at the end, the dark baptism of the Rizzis\\' son, Michael Francis (played by baby Sofia Coppola), before the infant\\'s godfather Michael Corleone. Between these scenes, the movie unfolds on constricted, shadowy stages, hidden arenas on which Mob factions grapple. Through it all, we can see that the qualities we prize in Vito and his son - loyalty, ambition, sensitivity and lively intelligence - are part of what makes them effective mafiosi, able to manipulate and outwit more brutish competitors. Blood tells.\\nThe links between business, politics and crime are a big part of \"The Godfather.\" And the tension between warmth and massacre - the Corleone famiglia of blood ties and the A Corleone family celebration, the wedding of Connie Corleone (Talia Shire) and Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo), opens \"The Godfather.\" \"The Godfather\" **** Directed by Francis Ford Coppola; written by Mario Puzo, Coppola and Robert Towne (uncredited), based on Puzo\\'s novel; photographed by Gordon Willis; edited by William Reynolds, Peter Zinner; production designed by Dean Tavoularis; music by Nino Rota (wedding scene: Carmine Coppola); produced by Albert S. Ruddy. Restoration editor Walter Murch. A Paramount Pictures release; opens Friday. Running time: 2:55.\\nMPAA rating: R. Language, sensuality, nudity, violence.

And they help endow Don Vito with a kind of nobility, even as we learn his sordid history.\\nStill, anybody who chooses to view the Corleones sentimentally or romantically - to cheer their bloody triumphs like a Western shootout - has grievously missed the movie\\'s point. \"The Godfather,\" in stark contrast to most of today\\'s films, is ambitious both morally and artistically, studded with powerful performances and memorable lines, biting speeches that resound in our collective ear and imagination with a renewed, haunting familiarity: \"Bonasera, Bonasera: What have I done to make you treat me so disrespectfully?\" \"I need, Don Corleone, those politicians you carry in your pocket like so many nickels and dimes.\\' \"It means: Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.\" \"It\\'s not personal, Sonny. It\\'s strictly business.\" \"I never wanted this for you. I work my whole life - I don\\'t apologize - to take care of my family. And I refused to be a fool, dancing on a string held by all those big shots.\\n. . \"Tom, can you get me off the hook, for old time\\'s sake?\" (\"Can\\'t do it, Sally.\") \"I\\'m gonna make him an offer he can\\'t refuse.\" That pungent dialogue - by Puzo, Coppola and uncredited script doctor Robert (\"Chinatown\") Towne - is matched by \"The Godfather\\'s\" plangent score, by Federico Fellini\\'s composer, Nino Rota. And by its autumnal images: of faces bathed in inky shadow and streets swallowed in night, all lit harshly and radiantly by cinematographer Gordon Willis. The acting, of course, is the picture\\'s heart and soul.\\nJust as Don Vito passed his torch to Michael, Brando was probably both inspiration and big buddy for Pacino and the feisty young cast. Some of the best of their generation, they may have all idolized the star of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and \"On the Waterfront\" as the king of movie naturalism. Brando\\'s remarkable performance, hoarse mumble and all, was partly modeled on recordings of raspy-voiced New York Mob boss Frank Costello. But Brando went further, made Don Vito something we rarely see in movies: a tragicomic villainhero, a vulnerable hood. The don is so close to a comic character - the movie itself is so close to comedy - that Brando\\'s capacity to move us in the role is doubly impressive.\\nAt the end, it is the older Godfather\\'s tenderness and sagacity we recall. There\\'s been a sea change in movies since \"\\'The Godfather,\" on a $7 million budget, broke the box office records in 1972. And a change as well in today\\'s audience, which long ago handed over the box-office crown to more juvenile, less dramatically bold or ambitious shows like \"E.T.\" and \"Star Wars.\\' But should there be so much more excitement today over the re-release of the \"Star Wars\" trilogy than over the re-release of this towering masterpiece: a film that many critics see as one of the crowning works of American movies? Watching \"The Godfather\" now, you feel, as in very few other American film classics, a sense of history, generations and the ceaseless sweep of time. From the vantage point of a quarter century, \"The Godfather\" carries a charge of sadness, too. It induces some of the awe and regret we feel seeing 99 Orson Welles\\' \"Citizen Kane.\\' How wonderful the movies once were, we may feel.\\nHow much they had to say and how beautifully they could say it. Why can\\'t they be that way today? Too much money? Too little ambition? Maybe Michael Corleone himself has the explanation: \"It\\'s not personal, Sonny. It\\'s strictly business.\\'.\\nUnited States\\nIllinois\\nChicago\\nChicago Tribune\\n1997\\nMar\\n21\\nPage 355\\nThe Godfather 2*\\nSubscribe\\nGift Subscriptions\\nHelp\\nSite Map\\nAbout\\nFish Wrap—Official Blog\\nAffiliates\\nContent Providers\\nUnited States (English)\\nVisit our other sites\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nInstagram\\n© 2024 Newspapers.com™ by Ancestry®.

Anyone even remotely interested in film - or American popular culture - is familiar, probably intimately so, with at least these snippets from The Godfather. For me, as an aspiring young film nerd, watching these films (yes, even the third one) was something like a rite of passage, a sort of baptism into serious cinephilia. I still remember clearly: I was around 13 and my dad, knowing that I had suddenly fallen hard into movies, brought back from the video store one Friday The Godfather. We watched all together as a family, appropriately. The overwhelming feeling that I still recall from that first viewing was the epic sweep of the film—the amount of time, geography, character, and sheer narrative it covered in its sprawling running time. I was hooked. The next Friday, my dad brought back Part II, and the Friday after that, Part III.\\nI’ve seen them all countless times since then, the original probably my most re-watched film. I find myself more moved by the films (yes, even the third one) each time I watch them, even though I wasn’t particularly emotionally invested on my initial viewings. I was focused too much on the overall operatic form, the solemn and stately classicism that Coppola brought to his pulpy material (surely Godfather I & II qualify as near-perfect examples of classical narrative form). Perhaps I was just too young to appreciate the density of feeling saturating the film, the utterly natural and lived-in closeness of the characters. For in the end, while the film set the template for how we conceive of the Mafia, the film is about family (small “f”) more than anything else. I always found Coppola’s protestations that The Godfather steered his career away from the kinds of “personal” films he wanted to make to be disingenuous—these were the most personal films Coppola would ever make. The films ring so true because Coppola imbued them with his Italian heritage, his family’s immigrant background, his knowledge of how an ethnic minority community interacts. Hell, he cast his sister and daughter and commissioned his father to help write the score (for Part II)! In the process, he told the Great American story: the immigrant story, the story of self-made striving, of the death of Old World sensibilities at the hands of the second-generation’s ruthless - and All-American - capitalistic decadence. The Godfather films remain so powerful, so ubiquitous, because in the Corleones we see the American Dream—and in turn, ourselves.\\nReview by Rumsey Taylor\\nThe existence of this publication was compelled by a particular, if subliminal notion: that older films are generally easier to write about than newer ones. Newer ones encounter a sort of competition, especially in the current era of film criticism, which is seemingly at its most democratic and populated. Films are canonized, laureled or demeaned within moments, always before they’re publicly distributed, as opposed to the comparatively glacial pace at which it generally took older films to arrive at their deserved extent of acclaim.\\nI prefer not to participate in this race toward canonization for new films, because the more laureled, the more popular and seen a film becomes, the less integral its criticism—it is as if once a film is viewed a certain number of times, a proper evaluation emerges, and this evaluation remains largely unaffected by contrary assessments. Criticism exists to validate an art, so what purpose does it serve art that is so popularly comprehended? Obviously, there is a purpose in this - it’s fun to play contrarian, always, and the public consensus is often wrong - but asserting this purpose is, for me, difficult.\\nThis is why it took me over three decades to see The Godfather and its equally esteemed sequel. They are with no hyperbole whatsoever two of the most critically lauded films ever. A summary of their combined renown:\\nProminent ranking on most every list of the best films ever made\\nAn inexorable influence on every single gangster film made hence\\nThe Godfather belongs to a subset of films about which I suspect I will have absolutely nothing new to report, and as such motivation to watch it climaxes in a little more than a casual curiosity. Responses to it have been so widespread that very nearly every person I have come in contact with has seen and enjoyed it. It is an endorsement so commonly impassioned that I feel I am familiar with the film by virtue of absorption.\\nPrior to seeing both films, I knew of their iconic scores, performances, and key scenes, most of them from the first film. What I hadn’t anticipated was the strength of the supporting characters. In particular, James Caan in Part I, whose casual temper is somehow epitomized in his dress slacks and tank top ensemble, punctuated in suspenders and a pair of hairy shoulders. There is also Dianne Keaton, something of a fulcrum for Michael Corleone’s transition into the Don in the same film, who inhabits a role whose privilege and luxury is enabled expressly by deception. And my favorite: Fredo in Part II. He is a character so tragic that he is almost singularly responsible for engendering the series’ pathos.\\nAnchoring all the performances are Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, and Al Pacino, who portray the Don and his son at multiple generations: from young Vito’s immigration to the United States at the birth of the century to his son’s, Michael, assumption of the family business a generation later, and his futile attempt to make the business legit. What the first two Godfather films depict, by and large, is the same thing: that the aspect of the mob and violence is an afterthought to the concept of family, of asserting one’s place in a country they have vulnerably entered.\\nIf there is a surfacing trend in this feature, then it’s that blind spots sometimes provide experiences different from those anticipated—Rocky’s romance, for example, or High Noon’s lack of Americanness. The Godfather was less perversely about the foundation of a mob network than it was the foundation of a family—a family that has seen difficulties most do not, and one that faces these difficulties with utmost rationale and tenderness. I watched awaiting the sudden spill of oranges across an alley street that punctuates Vito’s death, Sonny’s hyper-violent death scene in which he is pelted by bullets from every possible direction, the revelation of a decapitated horse, and the image of Michael’s face as it comes to a boil in anger as he confronts the man who ordered his father’s death. What I remember now, more than anything else, is Fredo’s desperate embrace of his brother Michael at their mother’s funeral, a climax of emotion so intense that one forgives the near-fatal injustice that preceded it.\\nThe Godfather is a film that confronts my insecurities as a writer because it invites no criticism whatsoever. There is no better way to alienate a readership than to naively and incapably disagree with what they like, and no better way to bore them than to redundantly support the consensus. But in the interest of confronting this insecurity, and in conclusion, I opt to describe the circumstances of my viewing: this past year it was made aware to one of my friends that I had seen neither of these films, an admission so apparently offensive that a plan was made - at that moment, near midnight on a Saturday - to see it immediately. This encouraged a hesitance I’ve been practicing all my life, but it was finally not enough, and I stipulated that I would need some coffee before the proceedings. Over three hours later, the single cup of coffee served to me remained untouched at my side.\\nI couldn’t wait to see the sequel.\\nBy Rumsey Taylor and Timothy Sun   ©2011 NotComing.com\\nMore Blind Spots\\nPee-wee’s Big Adventure\\n1985\\nThe Matrix\\n1999\\nAmélie\\n2001\\nThe Breakfast Club\\n1985\\nPsycho\\n1960\\nBlade Runner\\n1982\\nChinatown\\n1974\\nMonty Python and the Holy Grail\\n1975\\nRocky\\n1976\\nHigh Noon\\n1952\\nFerris Bueller’s Day Off\\n1986\\nTaxi Driver\\n1976\\nThe Godfather\\n1972\\nE.T.\\n1982\\nPulp Fiction\\n1994\\nWe don’t do comments anymore, but you may contact us here or find us on Twitter or Facebook.\\nWe’re sorry!

The film displays the mob in a realistic dark tone though all the violence is important to the story and painted in a bad way. One of the most famous scenes in the film shows a man waking up in his bed to a severed horse head in his bed, it’s not too graphic though animal lovers may dislike it. One disturbing scene shows a man beating his wife (I skipped it), she smashes his plates on the floor because she is angry and he corners her in the bathroom, the camera cuts away and you can only hear her cry (it’s heavily implied he beat her). It’s important to remember basically everybody getting hurt or dying is a criminal themselves and are just as bad as the person killing them. Language 4/10 - It has extremely tame language for an R rated film. 7 uses of “bitch”, 5 uses of “ass”, 1 use of “dick” and some ethnic slurs include one use of the n-word, and many slurs against Italians. Sex/Nudity 5/10 - In one scene two characters are walked in on while having sex (Their clothed and it stops almost instantly), a woman reveals her breasts to her husband (Their shown briefly, I just skipped it), one other scene shows Sonny having sex with his mistress, their clothed and it isn’t shown (It is audible however, again I just skipped it) Drugs 3/10 - Drug trafficking is a minor plot point in the story, no drug use is shown just brief talk of it, it is presented as a dirty, risky, business type\\nShow more\\nCSMContentDefault Adult\\nMay 23, 2020\\nage 15+\\nSlow and methodical masterpiece depiction of sociopathy\\nWhile having a reputation for its slow pace, The Godfather\\'s performances and tense atmosphere make every scene a pleasure to watch.

REAPER #GRMDRPR\\nReview: ‘The Godfather’\\nWith all due respect to this 1972 classic, Vizzini was right: Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line.\\nIn a post-war America, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a powerful mafia family but better known to friends and associates as “Godfather.” His youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino) is a decorated World War II Marine war hero who has managed to stay out of the family business. After rivals gun down Vito but fail to kill him, Michael’s older brother Sonny (James Caan) tries to hold the family business together but doesn’t have the temperament of his father. Michael finds himself having to step up to protect the father he loves but in the process takes his first step into the seductively violent and powerful world his father never wanted for him.\\nFull disclosure: before now, I had never once sat down to watch The Godfather in its entirety. It was just one of those films that repeatedly escaped my viewing although I made no specific attempt to avoid it. Now with a boxed set of all three films in a fresh digital transfer restoration, the first film looks pristine and sounds incredible; it could have been made yesterday. As a period piece set decades before the year it was actually made, it is filmed and edited beautifully, making almost three hours seem very short. Even knowing what to expect after years of spoofs and outright theft from this film in no way diminished the viewing experience, and that speaks volumes as to why it is widely regarded an American classic.\\nEven as their story lures you in to relate to these characters, there really aren’t any “good” guys to be found, just the innocents in the crossfire as a source of more guilt for our characters to carry. As the focus of the story, Al Pacino’s Michael has the widest character arc, starting off looking like Matthew Broderick fresh from Biloxi Blues before morphing into someone who would go on to play Scarface; it’s a believable change from beginning to end. Seeing the look of shock on his face after the restaurant scene to the cold calculator who lies to his godson’s father is the very definition of transition, and Pacino made it look easy.\\nAs one of the most lampooned performances in cinematic history, Marlon Brando’s Don Corleone is so naturally dead on that it’s hard not to poke fun at it, but you wouldn’t do it to his face. The performance is so nuanced with quirks both visual and audible that one might assume this isn’t an act; seriously, he’s just really like that, right? By the time he falls in the garden playing with his grandson, it feels like losing your favorite grandpa, especially with what Michael does immediately afterward.\\nFrom New York to Los Angeles to Sicily, The Godfather tells the story from the criminal’s point of view as an honorable family is forced to lower itself to the standards of usurpers who know no other way. One of the most telling moments is Michael explaining to his girl what he’s done for his father’s safety and makes a reference to governments and presidents. When she innocently comments that presidents and governments don’t assassinate people in their way, he answers, “You’re not that naive, are you?” Instead of the high-life living, palace dwelling untouchables of yesteryear, this is the stressful, back room dealing, take-out eating, unglamorous picture of a mob family that would later inspire imitators like HBO’s “The Sopranos” (and we should all be so lucky that it did.)\\n(a four skull recommendation out of four)\\nRate this:\\n1 Vote\\nShovel Our Graveyard Dirt:\\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\\nClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\\nClick to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\\nMore\\nLoading...\\nRelated\\nReview: ‘The Rite’\\nJanuary 30, 2011\\nIn \"2011\"\\nReview: ‘Midway’ (Roland Emmerich schools Michael Bay)\\nNovember 11, 2019\\nIn \"2019\"\\nReview: ‘War of the Worlds’ (2005)\\nJune 30, 2005\\nIn \"2005\"\\n1999 OR EARLIER MOVIE MOVIECRYPT.COM REVIEW\\nPublished by Grim D.

The film chronicles his life and that of his son Michael (Al Pacino) who eventually inherits the title of Godfather.\\nThe film is about the importance of family life, the relationship between a father and his sons, power, loyalty, corruption and succession all underscored by composer Nino Rota's iconic music.\\nIf you haven't seen it already, bada bing, give it a shot.\\nScreened at the GFT, and Edinburgh Filmhouse today and selected multi-plex cinemas throughout the coming week.\\n  Follow\\nTheScottishDailyRecord\\n@Daily_Record\\nFIND JOBS IN SCOTLAND\\n  1000s of Vacancies from top Scottish recruitment agencies and employers\\n  Recommended On The Record\\nHAMILTON\\nSupport for Hamilton MSP's campaign against revenge porn\\nLAW AND ACCOUNTANCY\\nScott-Moncrieff promotes two to partner\\nEDINBURGH\\nBody found in River as police search for missing man Robert Toshack\\nLAW AND ACCOUNTANCY\\nThree new partners for Morton Fraser\\nGLASGOW\\nPoppy Appeal Glasgow: Youth Muslim organisation to take to city streets this weekend to raise funds\\nCOSMETICS\\nCC Says beauty review: How beauty and complementary therapies help me to live with MS\\nBLOODY SCOTLAND CRIME WRITING FESTIVAL\\nPeter May books place in hall of fame\\nBUYSELL\\n  BuySell is packed full with your local tradesmen.

I’ve also grown up in the post-Godfather world, which set the tone for almost every gangster and crime films since. Even still, I fully believe in the brilliance of the film as one of the greatest ever. Coppola offers a rich and layered look at family and does so with an incredible cast and a meticulous amount of detail.\\nDespite their suspect background and influence and power in New York’s world of organized crime, the Corleone clan holds their familial bond as their most important asset. Perhaps the best known story of the family bond is the biblical parable of the prodigal son who returns home after being away for a long time. In leaving the son creates a disconnect from his family’s bond, but the moment he returns, the power of father and son heals everything instantly. Based on the novel by Mario Puzo, The Godfather is a modern retelling of the parable, only done so in reverse.\\nThe prodigal son is Michael Corleone (Al Pacino). Rather than being the hedonistic son depicted in the Biblical parable, Michael is a responsible and noble member of the American military. Michael fully understands his family and never speaks down to it, but he’s put some distance between himself and the underground world he was raised in. Michael is introduced at the start of the film as a guest at his sister’s wedding. While everyone else is dressed in their best suits and dresses, the youngest son arrives in his military garb setting himself apart from the rest of the extended family. He’s an outsider who has to explain himself to his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) and why he stands out. They stick to themselves for a while, trying in futility to blend in. It’s not long before Michael’s arrival is noticed by others and he’s called upon to reunite with his parents and siblings. In some ways the excitement of Michael’s homecoming overshadows his sister’s big day.\\nMichael leaves a short time later but is forced to return after his father nearly dies. Michael comes to the aid of the Corleones and he fully embraces his family’s criminal ties. So begins Michael’s descent from American hero to major player in organized crime. But the trade-off isn’t all black and white. Although a criminal, Michael is also closer to his family than ever.\\nThis is really just one of the several rich stories told within the context of this one sweeping epic. As the members of the Corleone family interact with one another, their stories are told. It’s one of few films that I’ve seen where you’re able to see each character develop and have a purpose. The writing is tight and not a moment is wasted.\\nCelebrations and gatherings play a major role in The Godfather. This allows lots of characters to be shown at once, but more importantly they demonstrate the importance of family. They’re always together, whether it’s for a party, special occasion or just for a nice meal. But given the family’s background, it’s also a smokescreen for the wrong they commit. So are the Corleone’s good or are they bad? It all depends on what lens you look through. From a valiant perspective where the law is gospel, then they’re all a bunch of hoods and murderers. But to each other the Corleones are a family and they’ll do anything for one another, no matter the personal cost. That’s the lens Coppola uses as he constructs this masterful work of character and epic storytelling.\\nThe Godfather DVD Review\\nWhen you’re one of the greatest films of all-time then you deserve only the best. Despite having a solid (and originally pricey) release as a boxed set a few years ago, Francis Ford Coppola wanted to make things better. Now he proudly presents “The Coppola Restoration” box set in which both The Godfather and The Godfather Part II have both undergone meticulous restorations.\\nThe Godfather has been cleaned up and looks cleaner and sharper than I’ve ever seen it on both the previous VHS and DVD copies I’ve owned. It also has a new Dolby 5.1 Surround audio track as well as a 5.1 French track and an English mono track. Subtitles are offered in English, French and Spanish. Francis Ford Coppola offers up a very informative and far-reaching commentary track that not only offers up how the film came to be, but insights into his own work and struggles.\\nThe remaining bonus features are bundled together on not one but two bonus discs. One disc contains features that were all released with the last DVD box set a few years ago. Nine featurettes make up a deep and rounded look at the making of the film. Everything from writing to cinematography to music to sets are covered. Additional features include deleted scenes, a Corleone family tree that connects many of the characters, an image gallery and short written biographies for major crew members.\\nNew bonus features continue to amaze in the number of angles extras can be taken. “Godfather World” looks at the impact The Godfather franchise has had on pop culture and makes connections to both The Sopranos, South Park and The Simpsons, amongst others. “The Masterpiece That Almost Wasn’t” tracks how Hollywood, amidst a tremendous change away from the studio system, nearly led to The Godfather not being made. Not only is it another look at the film, but it’s also an interesting and revealing piece on Hollywood history. “…when the shooting stopped” explores the post production and the conflict over the control. “Emulsion Rescue: Revealing The Godfather” talks about the restoration process the film underwent for this release. For some reason, stars who just happened to be at the premiere of Cloverfield comment on what they think of The Godfather in “The Godfather on the Red Carpet.” That’s synergy for you. And it’s really feels out of place here. Under the title “Four Short Films on The Godfather” there’s a hodgepodge of additional extras. The first, “The Godfather vs. The Godfather Part II” has critics and stars debate their favourite of the two films. The remaining shorts put the spotlight on random quotes, cannoli and the fate of Clemenza. All of the new features can be subtitled in English, French or Spanish.\\nIt’s not really a big deal, but still something worth noting. The bonus discs were mislabeled in the set I received. It’s nothing huge, just discs four and five having the wrong titles on the disc. I’m not sure if this was an error with all of the sets or if it’s going to be corrected.\\n  The Godfather Gallery\\n\\n\\n  Trailer\\n  Related Posts\\nThe Godfather Part II\\nThe Godfather Part III\\nEl Dorado\\nBraveheart\\nHearts of Darkness\\nThe Mary Tyler Moore Show: Season Five\\nTags:\\n1972Al PacinoBest Picture WinnersDVDFrancis Ford CoppolaJames CaanMario PuzoMarlon BrandoParamountRichard S.

Murder, betrayal, ambition: it's all here, and utterly compelling, with Brando at his scene-stealing best\\n\\nThis is where it all went right - or wrong - for Coppola. He wanted to become an artist, albeit a wealthy one, of American cinema. Instead he was sucked into mainstream Hollywood when he reluctantly agreed to take on this overtly commercial picture.\\nWith Gordon Willis's majestic cinematography, Dean Tavoularis's designs, Nino Rota's music and at least half a dozen great performances, Coppola created a copper-bottomed Hollywood masterpiece. It seems incredible now that he had to battle the studio to cast Brando, then in a career slump, as Don Vito Corleone. His magnificently restrained, cotton-wool-enhanced performance is the film's fulcrum. From the very first exquisitely staged and acted sequence, Brando exudes authority and quiet menace.\\n\\nCoppola also had to fight to cast Pacino as Vito's golden boy, war hero Michael, but he too turns in a rich, assured performance as the man who must come to terms with his malign destiny. In addition, Duvall, Cazale, Caan and Keaton are all on top form in a film that moves gracefully from set-piece to set-piece, arriving at a breathtaking climax.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    page 1 of 1    \\n  RATE THIS FILM\\nmarks out of 10\\n10\\n9\\n8\\n7\\n6\\n5\\n4\\n3\\n2\\n1\\nreview this film\\n\\nRent this now:\\nGET 6 FREE DVD RENTALS\\n\\n  UK CINEMA LISTINGS\\nand/or\\n\\n ON\\nDVD/VIDEO\\nSOUNDTRACK\\nBOOK\\n\\nTOP LINKS\\n\\nLatest film reviews\\n\\nLatest DVD reviews\\n\\nLatest movie trailers\\n\\nThe Ultimate Film\\n\\nThe Big Bad Movie Quiz\\n\\n100 Greatest War Films\\n\\n100 Greatest Tearjerkers\\n\\n100 Greatest Films\\n\\n100 Greatest Sexy Moments\\n\\n100 Greatest Movie Stars\\n\\n100 Greatest Musicals\\n\\nMovies Coming Soon\\n\\nFilmmaking Guide\\n\\nFilm Forums\\n\\n\\n   Contact  |   Text Only  |   Advertising  |   Privacy  |   Help  |   Contributors  |   Terms\"}, {'ReviewID': 101, 'Critic': '    Related Item\\nGo to Video Finder\\n  \\'Godfather\\': Offer Accepted\\n\\nBy Desson Howe\\nWashington Post Staff Writer\\nFriday, March 21, 1997\\n\\n \\n\\nMarlon Brando won an Oscar for \"The Godfather.\" (Paramount)\\n\\nDirector:\\nFrancis Ford Coppola\\nCast:\\nMarlon Brando;\\nAl Pacino;\\nJames Caan;\\nRichard Castellano;\\nRobert Duvall;\\nSterling Hayden;\\nJohn Marley;\\nRichard Conte;\\nDiane Keaton\\nRunning Time:\\n2 hours, 55 minutes\\n\\nContains sexual situations, profanity and violence\\nOscars:\\nBest Picture; Actor (Marlon Brando); Adapted Screenplay\\n\"The Godfather,\" which has been re-released on its 25th anniversary, is a jewel that still glows across time – and in the dark. Gordon Willis\\'s cinematography, considered revolutionary at the time, plunged its characters into pools of semi-darkness. Studio executives – always the last ones to get it – howled in the screening rooms. But in this saga of an Italian-American family\\'s bid for power, we were watching the American Dream operating in the darkest shadows.\\nLuckily, America saw the light. The movie, released in March 1972 and directed by an unknown eccentric called Francis Ford Coppola, was a smash hit – the first film to top $100 million in its initial release. It won three Academy Awards (for Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Screenplay Adaptation). It lit a fire under the careers of Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire. It entered the pantheon of American cinema; and it has informed virtually every crime movie in the last quarter century, from \"Scarface\" to \"Donnie Brasco.\"\\nIn the story, which Mario Puzo and Coppola adapted from Puzo\\'s novel, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) presides over a tight-knit clan which includes his hotheaded eldest son, Sonny (James Caan), his adopted son and family advisor, Tom Hagen (Duvall), and youngest son, Michael (Pacino), the apple of his father\\'s eye who has – thus far – been kept out of the family business.\\nThat business happens to be prostitution, protection rackets and gambling. In a constant struggle for power among New York\\'s rival gangster families, Don Corleone rules with Machiavellian grace.\\nWhen adversaries refuse his wishes, he \"makes them an offer they can\\'t refuse.\" The procedure is simple: His goons point a gun against the head of anyone who needs persuasion. But Don Corleone is also a benevolent figure who – in this morally relative underworld – rights the wrongs of his friends and relatives.\\nInto this world comes Michael, the returning war hero (the year is 1946), who finally agrees to take his father\\'s mantle and run the family. His ascension is the stuff of American cinematic myth. Standing before his father, who lies in a hospital bed after barely surviving an attempt on his life, Michael kisses Don Corleone\\'s hand and whispers, \"I\\'m with you now.\"\\nCoppola, then in his thirties, reluctantly heeded the advice of his friend George Lucas to make this picture. To him, this was a commercially unpalatable project that had nothing to do with his personal ambition: to change the way Hollywood made movies.\\nHow wrong he was. There are volumes that could be written – and have been – about the movie\\'s uniformly powerful performances; its precedent-setting editing by William Reynolds and Peter Zinner; Nino Rota\\'s haunting score; and Dean Tavoularis\\'s evocative set design. But Coppola must get most of the credit.\\nWith Puzo, he forged an epic tragedy about America, capitalism, family, greed, treachery and love. He showed us – with almost Shakespearean gravitas – the errors of hasty vengeance and the wisdom of assured leadership. He gave us a great American picture, full of incredible images and lasting moments. There are too many to choose from, but I leave you with two here: When Michael – hearing about the assault on his father – scrambles into a telephone booth to call the family, his girlfriend (Diane Keaton) waits outside in the cold. It\\'s clear that she\\'s literally being kept out of the picture. Much later, when a door is closed between her and her husband – as he conducts family business – this estrangement is not only reconfirmed, it sets us up for \"The Godfather, Part II,\" a movie that achieved the impossible: to equal its predecessor.\\n   \\n© Copyright 1999 The Washington Post Company\\n\\nBack to the top\\n\\n '}, {'ReviewID': 102, 'Critic': \"Plus Icon\\nFilm\\nPlus Icon\\nTV\\nPlus Icon\\nWhat To Watch\\nPlus Icon\\nMusic\\nPlus Icon\\nDocs\\nPlus Icon\\nDigital & Gaming\\nPlus Icon\\nGlobal\\nPlus Icon\\nAwards Circuit\\nPlus Icon\\nVideo\\nPlus Icon\\nWhat To Hear\\nVIP\\nPlus Icon\\nClick to expand the Mega Menu\\nPlus Icon\\nClick to Expand Search Input\\nGot a Tip?\\nNewsletters\\nSwitch edition between\\nU.S. Edition\\nVariety\\nLogin\\nHome\\nFilm\\nReviews\\nMar 7, 1972 11:00pm PT\\nFilm Review: The Godfather\\nBy A.D. Murphy\\nPlus Icon\\nCourtesy of Paramount Pictures\\nWith several million hardcover and paperback books acting as trailers, Paramount’s film version of Mario Puzo‘s sprawling gangland novel, “The Godfather,” has a large pre-sold audience. This will bolster the potential for the film which has an outstanding performance by Al Pacino and a strong characterization by Marlon Brando in title role. It also has excellent production values, flashes of excitement, and a well-picked cast. But it is also overlong at about 175 minutes (played without intermission), and occasionally confusing. While never so placid as to be boring, it is never so gripping as to be superior screen drama. This should not mar Paramount’s b.o. expectations in any measure, though some filmgoers may be disappointed.\\nFrancis Ford Coppola directed the Albert S. Ruddy production, largely photographed in N.Y. Dean Tavoularis was production designer and Gordon Willis cinematographer (Technicolor) for the handsome visual environment, which besides World War II and postwar styles and props, is made further intriguing by some sort of tinting effect. There are people under 40 who grew up in the period of the film and who recall such color tones as evocative of 20 years earlier, that is, the end of the Roaring Twenties and the Depression. Evidently the artistic effect here is to show some sort of antiquity which no longer exists.\\nRelated Stories\\nVIP+\\nWhy Sony Is Betting on ‘Palworld’ After the Early Hype\\nTIFF Lineup: Pam Anderson's 'Last Showgirl,' Ben and J. Lo Project 'Unstoppable,' Papal Thriller 'Conclave' and More \\nPuzo and Coppola are credited with the adaptation which best of all gives some insight into the origins and heritage of that segment of the population known off the screen (but not on it) as the Mafia or Cosa Nostra. Various ethnic counter-cultures are part of the past and part of the present, and the judgment of criminality is in part based on the attitudes of the outside majority. Nobody ever denied that a sense of family, cohesion and order are integral, positive aspects of such subgroups; it’s just the killing and slaughter that upsets the outsiders.\\nPopular on Variety\\nIn “The Godfather,” we have the New York-New Jersey world, ruled by five “families,” one of them headed by Brando. This is a world where emotional ties are strong, loyalties are somewhat more flexible at times, and tempers are short.\\nIn makeup and physical movement instantly evocative of Orson Welles as Charles Foster Kane in “Citizen Kane,” Brando does an admirable job as the lord of his domain. He is not on screen for much of the film, though his presence hovers over all of it.\\nIt is Pacino, last seen (by too few) in “Panic In Needle Park,” who makes the smash impression here. Initially seen as the son whom Brando wanted to go more or less straight (while son James Caan was to become part of the organization), Pacino matures under the trauma of an assassination attempt on Brando, his own double-murder revenge for that on corrupt cop Sterling Hayden and rival gangster Al Lettieri, the counter-vengeance murder of his Sicilian bride, and a series of other personnel readjustments which at fadeout find him king of his own mob.\\nIn a lengthy novel filled with many characters interacting over a period of time, readers may digest the passing parade in convenient sittings. But in a film, the audience is forced to get it all at one time. Thus it is incumbent on filmmakers to isolate, heighten and emphasize for clarity the handful of key characters; some of that has been done here, and some of it hasn’t. The biggest achievement here is the establishment of mood and time.\\nAmong the notable performances are Robert Duvall as Hagen, the non-Italian number-two man finally stripped of authority after long years of service; Richard Castellano as a loyal follower; John Marley as a Hollywood film mogul pressured into giving a comeback film role in a war film to Al Martino, an aging teenage idol; Richard Conte as one of Brando’s malevolent rivals; Diane Keaton as Pacino’s early sweetheart, later second wife; Abe Vigoda as an eventual traitor to Pacino; Talia Shire as Brando’s daughter, married to a weak and traitorous husband Gianni Russo; John Cazale, another son who moved to Las Vegas when that area attracted the mob, including Alex Rocco as another recognizable character; Morgana King as Brando’s wife; and Lenny Montana as a mobster.\\nNino Rota’s fine score, plus several familiar poptunes of the period, further enhance the mood, and all the numerous technical production credits are excellent. So, at the bottom line, the film has a lot of terrific mood, one great performance by Pacino, an excellent character segue by Brando, and a strong supporting cast. That will be enough for some, only half the job for others.\\nMurf.\\nRead More About:\\nDick Smith, Gordon Willis, Mario Puzo, The Godfather\\nFilm Review: The Godfather\\nProduction: Paramount Pictures release of Albert S.

What can you say that hasn\\'t been said a million times before, in newspapers, magazines, and on the Internet? Is there a cliché that hasn\\'t been used, or a compliment that hasn\\'t been paid? Is there anything original left to say about The Godfather?\\nThe Godfather. The story of a Mafia family dynasty and the transfer of power from father to son. The movie that made stars of James Caan, Robert Duval, Diane Keaton, and Al Pacino. The movie that proved to the world that Marlon Brando was no has been. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards, it also made a star of its director, Francis Ford Coppola.\\nWhat makes this movie so good? It is the perfect culmination of a great script (based on the excellent novel of the same name), a genius director working at his best, and a perfect cast. All these reasons are what inspire the clichés, such as; compelling, gripping, and intense. The story is that of a royal family. Brando plays the King, or in this case the Godfather. His princes are Michael, Sonny, and Fredo. There are rival families also vying for power. And when the King is shot down, confined to his bed, it is up to the Princes to rule his kingdom in his absence and try to hold the family together at the same time.\\nThese are all ruthless people. They are killers, and criminals guilty of every conceivable crime, and yet you root for them throughout the movie. Despite all of it, these are very likable characters.\\nThere are many underlying themes going on in this movie. Two of the most important are control, and of course; family.\\nTo the Corleones, nothing is as important as family. The Godfather is a Mafia chief, but the words mob, or gang are never used. He is the head of the Family. He doesn\\'t demand cash for his services, only loyalty and friendship. If you are loyal to him, you are part of his family. It has nothing to do with blood or even marriage. Carlo marries the Godfather\\'s daughter, but he is not family. Johnny Fontaine is loyal, he is family. Tom Hagen is the adopted son, but he is family. Family is everything.\\nControl is what the Godfather seeks. Hence the puppet strings on the book cover and the movie poster. The Godfather will never be a puppet dancing on a string. He must hold the strings. He doesn\\'t approve of lack of control. Thus, his love of Sonny, but lack of respect for his lack of control over his anger. Fredo also fails on this front, having no control over his lust for women. Only, the youngest son, Michael, seems to have the sense of control that the Godfather sees as all-important. Control over events, surroundings, your desires, and others, with the Godfather sitting in the center of the whirlwind, holding all the strings.\\nIt is the ultimate clashing of these two themes that drive the underlying tension of the movie. The Godfather values family and control. What happens when the one thing he can\\'t control, is his family? His family is his one blind spot. He can\\'t control whom his daughter marries, or Sonny\\'s anger, or Fredo\\'s ineptness, or Michael\\'s decisions. He completely overlooks his godson\\'s faults. He makes his adopted son, his chief advisor, even though he lacks the killer instinct to hold that office. In the end, it is his family that brings him down. It is even his own son who fails to protect him, when he is shot in the street.\\nThere are so many things that could be said about this movie. That this was the movie that gave us the modern version of the Mob family. A version which really hasn\\'t changed, nearly thirty years later. So many classic lines, “I\\'m going to make him an offer he can\\'t refuse. It\\'s not personal. This is business.\" The vernacular that passed into our language, “He sleeps with the fishes. Go to the mattresses. Made his bones.\"\\nEvery scene in this movie is a classic, but there is one that always stands out in my mind. Michael (Al Pacino) stands guard outside the hospital where is father is lying after being shot. Next to him, is a friend, Enzo the Baker. Michael knows there are men coming to kill his father. A long, black car pulls up, two men peer out of it at them. Michael reaches for a non-existent gun inside his jacket, and the car drives off. Enzo removes a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and tries to light one, but his hands are shaking too much. Michael takes the lighter and does it for him. As he snaps the lighter shut, he glances at his hands. They are rock steady. And Michael will never be the same.\\nThe whole scene is shot without dialogue, but so much is said in that one simple shot of Michael looking at his hands. Until that moment he was not with the family. From then on, he will never be apart from it. He controlled his fear. And that says it all.\\nPatrick:\\nReviewed on: March 11th, 2002\\nAl Pacino in The Godfather.\\nOne element of the iconic status of this film apart from the many reasons Scott stated above, (all of which I agree with by the way), is that it sits poised perfectly between old Hollywood and new. The way The Godfather is shot, as well as the period look of it, are representative of the golden age of cinema. Even the casting of Marlon Brando reflects a sentimental nostalgia. However the brutal violence, the attitude of the characters and the realism in how the subject matter is shown are definitely products of the new era of film making that was happening in the early seventies. You can categorize movies as either pre-Godfather or post-Godfather.\\nThe chilling moment when the horse\\'s head is discovered in the movie producer\\'s bed is by far the most famous scene in the movie. It is still powerful and shocking even after many viewings. My favorite scene however, is Vito\\'s death among the tomato vines with his toddler grandson as lone witness. It is incredibly realistic and how poignant that this man who led a life of brutality should die in such an innocent manner. It is because of moments like this that we care so deeply about these ruthless individuals.\\nSo though it is a tired cliché by now to rank The Godfather, along with Citizen Kane and Casablanca, as the greatest American movie of all time, it is also accurate to do so. It is definitive and timeless.\\nEric:\\nReviewed on: March 11th, 2003\\nMarlon Brando in The Godfather.\\nAlthough The Godfather is a great movie on many levels, the real genius of it is Brando\\'s performance as Don Corleone. My favorite scenes that demonstrate this almost play like bookends to the movie, or at least bookends to the character of Don Corleone.\\nThe first scene is when Bonasera asks The Godfather to kill some men who abused his daughter. Don Corleone sits there casually stroking a cat as Bonasera nervously asks for his help, but Don Corleone does not make it easy on him. \"We\\'ve known each other for many years but this is the first time you\\'ve ever come to me for counsel or for help. I can\\'t remember the last time you invited me to your house for a cup of coffee, even though my wife is Godmother to your only child. But, let\\'s be frank here. You never wanted my friendship and you were afraid to be in my debt.\" This is great dialogue as we learn many things here. Bonasera is scared shitless of Don Corleone, but he is desperate. We also learn that Don Corleone sees business through the mask of family and friendship. He continues, \"Bonasera. What have I ever done to make you to treat me so disrespectfully. If you had come to me in friendship then this scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if by chance an honest man like yourself should make enemies then they would become my enemies. And then, they would fear you.\" Brando expertly walks a tight rope playing Don Corleone as both a sadistic mobster and a concerned friend. He scolds Bonasera at the same time he becomes his hero. This is Don Corleone in his element. This is the Godfather pulling the strings of his world.\\nLater in the movie Brando calls in his favor to Bonasera. He shows up at his mortuary with the bullet ridden body of his son, Sonny. \"Look how they massacred my boy...\" Brando cries to him as he pulls back the sheet covering his dead son. Bonasera reacts in shock, but he knows he must do what is asked of him. Sonny was a hot tempered bastard. He had affairs on his wife. His lack of self control often got him into trouble. Don Corleone knew this to be true, \"Never tell anybody outside the family what you\\'re thinking again!\" He once told him after an important meeting. But this is his son laying there dead on the slab, and your heart goes out to Don Corleone. This is the Godfather dealing with a problem outside his control. This is the Godfather acting less like a mob boss, and more like a father.\\nMarlon Brando makes a human being out of a what is essentialy a monster. Don Corleone has people killed or tortured when he sees fit. However, we are allowed to see his weaknesses as well as his love for his family, and thus we can relate to him, and feel pity. Sure The Godfather is a great novel, and Coppola does an amazing job directing, but this movie is made perfect by the incredible performance of Marlon Brando.\\nPhotos © Copyright Paramount Pictures (1972)\\nRelated Reviews\\nThe Godfather: Part II (1974)\\nThe Godfather: Part III (1990)\\nHome | Reviews | Articles |\\n© 2000 - 2017 Three Movie Buffs.

It won the Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando) and Best Adapted Screenplay. (It was based on the 1969 novel of the same name by Mario Puzo.) The American Film Institute ranked “The Godfather” as the second greatest movie in American cinematic history. The film is popular both with critics (#1 at Metacritic) and fans (#2 all-time at IMDB.com). Simply stated, it is one of the biggest success stories in movie history.\\nAnd it almost didn’t happen. Coppola was Paramount’s third choice after Italian director Sergio Leone and Peter Bogdanovich, and when the studio initially approached Coppola, he was reluctant to sign on because he was afraid that the film would glorify violence and depict Italian-Americans in a negative light. But he agreed to direct after having the idea to view the Corleone family through the spectrum of American capitalism. In spite of the film’s impending success, the Coppola-Paramount marriage was rocky at best. In fact, Coppola later said that the studio had another director shadowing him the entire time in case the higher-ups decided to make a change.\\nAt the time, gangster films typically portrayed the mafia from an outsider’s perspective, but “The Godfather” instead focused on the reality of the family. The Corleones are just like any other clan, only instead of running a bakery or a hardware store, they deal in prostitution, gambling and racketeering. The film doesn’t show any of these enterprises, however, instead focusing on the inner dynamics of the family. Vito (Brando) is the patriarch, and he relies on the counsel of Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his adopted son. Vito’s son, Sonny (James Caan), is a hothead and doesn’t have the temperament to take over as head of the family. The eldest son, Fredo (John Cazale), is a sweet guy who doesn’t have the smarts to contribute. When Vito is bedridden after an assassination attempt, another son, college grad and war hero Michael (played by a then-unknown Al Pacino), becomes more and more involved in the family business. On one level, “The Godfather” is about the final years of Vito’s reign. On another, it’s about how circumstances force Michael to embrace the Corleone legacy.\\nThis family/business dynamic is evident from the very first scene of the film, where a local funeral director is asking Vito to bring justice to a couple of thugs that attacked his daughter. As the Don discusses the terms of this “favor,” his daughter’s wedding reception is being held just outside the door. This is a stark contrast, but the Corleones have this compartmentalization down to a science, although it’s something that Michael’s girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), struggles with throughout the film.\\nIt’s hard to believe that there’s a generation of moviegoers who haven’t taken the time to appreciate “The Godfather.” Sure, “Goodfellas,” “The Departed” and “Scarface” are terrific stories in their own right, but they probably wouldn’t have been made without the success of Coppola’s epic. He proved that a film about the mafia could be made in a realistic, multi-dimensional way, and that it could appeal to a broad audience. By doing so, he opened the door for countless gangster films to follow.\\nBut “The Godfather” stands head and shoulders above the rest. Virtually every scene is dripping with intrigue and there is absolutely no fat, so the film’s 177 minutes go by in a snap. Its quiet intensity is enhanced by Nino Rota’s excellent score, which really takes center stage during the gorgeous landscapes shot in Italy.

Given the fact that the original films are more than 35 years old, the restoration looks absolutely gorgeous in full 1080p. While the box set features a plethora of special features, the single-disc version only has Coppola’s commentary. However, a good director’s commentary is often better than a dozen making-of featurettes, and Coppola’s certainly qualifies. He is candid about his relationship with Paramount and goes into great detail about all aspects of the making of “The Godfather.” Considering the four-disc box set can be had for about the same price as “The Godfather” and “The Godfather: Part II” in single-disc format, however, it probably pays to go the box set route.\\nAl Pacino Diane Keaton drama films Francis Ford Coppola James Caan John Cazale Marlon Brando movie reviews Robert Duvall\\nSHARE.\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\nGoogle+\\nPinterest\\nLinkedIn\\nTumblr\\nEmail\\nABOUT AUTHOR\\nSTAFF\\nRELATED POSTS\\nJULY 30, 2024\\n0\\nBlu Tuesday: “The First Omen”\\nJULY 23, 2024\\n0\\nBlu Tuesday: “The Fall Guy” and More\\nJULY 19, 2024\\n0\\nMovie Review: “Twisters”\\nFOLLOW US!\\nPAGES\\nPages - Home\\nCelebrity Babes\\nEntertainers\\nGuy Movies\\nTV\\nRECENT POSTS\\nTV Power Rankings Interviews – Fall 2010 August 3, 2024\\nBlu Tuesday: “The First Omen” July 30, 2024\\nDrink of the Week: The King of the Jungle (Mighty Joe Young) – TCM Fest 2024 Cocktail #1 July 26, 2024\\nBlu Tuesday: “The Fall Guy” and More July 23, 2024\\nMovie Review: “Twisters” July 19, 2024\\nBullz-Eye.com is an online men's lifestyle magazine that has been published since 2000.\\nYou can find our blog archive here.\\nBULLZ-EYE INFO\\nContact Us\\nPrivacy Policy\\nSite Map\"}, {'ReviewID': 110, 'Critic': \"This website utilizes technologies such as cookies to enable essential site functionality, as well as for analytics, personalization, and targeted advertising.

His eldest, Sonny (Caan), steps in to take the helm in his father\\'s illness, but is riddled with bullets. It is up to Michael (Pacino), the war hero and beloved son, to step up redeem the family\\'s honour.\\nBy Kim Newman | Published On23 08 1972\\nRelease Date:\\n23 Aug 1972\\nRunning Time:\\n175 minutes\\nCertificate:\\n18\\nOriginal Title:\\nGodfather, The\\nIt could be argued that Francis Ford Coppola\\'s film of Mario Puzo\\'s bestseller, at once an art movie and a commercial blockbuster, marked the dawn of the age of the mega-movie. Appropriately, the film is about a similar transition in organised crime, as the gentlemanly but sinister world of Don Vito (Brando) is eclipsed by the more brutal and expedient organisation represented by the doomed Sonny (Caan) and the calculating Michael (Pacino).\\nThe old gangster movie is represented by Richard Conte and Sterling Hayden in bit parts, while Brando\\'s cotton-cheeked patriarch represents everything about old Hollywood that Coppola aspired to. The younger generation is represented by the then fresh, exciting talents who remain respected names in their profession (Pacino, Robert Duvall, Caan, Diane Keaton). This is a film that has entered popular culture: even if you\\'ve never seen it, you know the lines (\"Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes\"), and some of the scenes (the horse\\'s head). But there\\'s more to it than moments imprinted on the psyche.\\nWith a period setting evoked by amber-tinted photography and Nino Rota\\'s elegantly decadent score, The Godfather has dated a lot less than most films of the early 70s. It paces itself deliberately, making its moments of action and horror more telling for the leisurely paths it weaves between them.

Ruddy; Paramount Pictures; 1972)\\n“The epic gangster film.”\\nReviewed by Dennis Schwartz\\nThe epic gangster film is family hardened and breathes fire into the belly of the contemporary gangster genre. It represents the best of what Hollywood can produce. A Mafia tale where it’s difficult to tell if art imitates fiction or if the reverse is true. Marlon Brando makes his grand movie comeback by stuffing either cotton or orange peel in his mouth so he can mumble, shows his love for cats, and becomes the godfather of all film-dom’s godfathers by dispensing favors with lifetime debts (a godfather or “don,” is the head of a Mafia family). There are offers made that can’t be refused, a severed horse’s head ends up in the bed, numerous heartwarming ethnic family occasions are laced with chilling undertones of mixing pleasure with business, stylish crosscutting shots between religious ritual and gore-filled machine-gun executions serve as some kind of poor man’s poetry, and a lesson in dining manners takes place in a trattoria (translating to a marked diner taken out gangland style with firepower and falling over the linguini).\\nThis lengthy but action-packed 1972 soap opera crime drama is one of the most popular American films ever made. It’s superbly acted, the script is sharp and witty, the 31-year-old director Francis Ford Coppola was never more on top of his game–creating a convincing and highly structured work that was both entertaining and worthy of much praise for bringing Mario Puzo’s best-selling novel to the screen in such a splashy style. Coppola also co-wrote The Godfather with Puzo.\\nThe film covers the Mafia wars between 1945-1955. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is the godfather’s youngest son, an Ivy League graduate and independent thinker, who rebelled against his father by enlisting in the Army to fight in World War II and has returned a war hero. Michael, rejecting the family business, shows up at the wedding of his sister Connie (Talia Shire) with his outsider non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who doesn’t know that he comes from a Mafia family until this occasion.\\nA short time later during the Christmas holiday season, the old-fashioned don refuses to go into the lucrative drug trade with an ambitious rising Mafia figure named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) and is almost assassinated when rival gangs back Sollozzo. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael decides to get involved in the family business and after much persuasion gets his volatile eldest brother Sonny (James Caan), bumbling middle brother Fredo (John Cazale), even-tempered family adviser, the consigliari, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and top gun Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) to approve of him being the one to exact revenge on his father’s enemies. Even though Hagen is Irish, Vito adopted him as a son and he’s become the brains behind the Corleones.\\nAfter murdering a corrupt police captain (Sterling Hayden) and the drug-trafficker responsible for trying to kill his father, Michael hides out in Sicily while a Mafia turf war erupts at home. In Sicily, Michael marries a local girl but she is later slain by Corleone foes when they fail to get him. Sonny is also slain in an ambush, having been betrayed by Connie’s husband. With so much bad news, Michael returns home and marries Kay. His father recovers and shrewdly makes peace with his rivals, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the scenes. Michael learns the ropes of being a don and when his chance comes he leads the family to greater heights of prosperity than ever by doing business in an efficient modern way. But by this time, Michael has become an amoral full-grown bad guy and initiates a campaign of murderous revenge against those who once tried to wipe out his family. He succeeds in consolidating his family’s power and that seemingly happy ending leaves room for some more sequels.\\nIt collected ten Academy Award nominations and won Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando) and Best Screenplay. It would remain the highest-grossing film until “Jaws” three years later.\\nREVIEWED ON 5/13/2004 GRADE: B+\\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE\\nMONTANA\\nAugust 5, 2019\\nLUZZU\\nOctober 13, 2021\\nTITANE\\nJuly 27, 2021\\nSearch\\nSEARCH\\nHome\\nReviews\\nTop Ten Lists\\nContact\\nCopyright 2024 - Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews'}, {'ReviewID': 122, 'Critic': 'www.movie-vault.com\\nVerifying you are human.

It\\'s the gangster melodrama come-of-age, truly sorrowful and truly exciting, without the false piety of the films that flourished 40 years ago, scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesn\\'t (or, at least, shouldn\\'t) pay.\\nIt still doesn\\'t, but the punishments suffered by the members of the Corleone Family aren\\'t limited to sudden ambushes on street corners or to the more elaborately choreographed assassinations on thruways. They also include life-long sentences of ostracism in terrible, bourgeois confinement, of money and power but of not much more glory than can be obtained by the ability to purchase expensive bedroom suites, the kind that include everything from the rug on the floor to the pictures on the wall with, perhaps, a horrible satin bedspread thrown in.\\nYet \"The Godfather\" is not quite that simple. It was Mr. Puzo\\'s point, which has been made somehow more ambiguous and more interesting in the film, that the experience of the Corleone Family, as particular as it is, may be the mid-20th-century equivalent of the oil and lumber and railroad barons of 19th-century America. In the course of the 10 years of intra-Mafia gang wars (1945-1955) dramatized by the film, the Corleones are, in fact, inching toward social and financial respectability.\\nFor the Corleones, the land of opportunity is America the Ugly, in which almost everyone who is not Sicilian or, more narrowly, not a Corleone, is a potential enemy. Mr. Coppola captures this feeling of remoteness through the physical look of place and period, and through the narrative\\'s point of view. \"The Godfather\" seems to take place entirely inside a huge smoky plastic dome, through which the Corleones see our real world only dimly.\\nThus, at the crucial meeting of Mafia families, when the decision is made to take over the hard drug market, one old don argues in favor, saying he would keep the trade confined to blacks--\"they are animals anyway.\"\\nThis is all the more terrifying because, within their isolation, there is such a sense of love and honor, no matter how bizarre.\\nThe film is affecting for many reasons, including the return of Marlon Brando, who has been away only in spirit, as Don Vito Corleone, the magnificent, shrewd, old Corleone patriarch. It\\'s not a large role, but he is the key to the film, and to the contributions of all of the other performers, so many actors that it is impossible to give everyone his due.\\nSome, however, must be cited, especially Al Pacino, as the college-educated son who takes over the family business and becomes, in the process, an actor worthy to have Brando as his father; as well as James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, Al Martino and Morgana King. Mr. Coppola has not denied the characters\\' Italian heritage (as can be gathered by a quick reading of the cast), and by emphasizing it, he has made a movie that transcends its immediate milieu and genre.\\n\"The Godfather\" plays havoc with the emotions as the sweet things of life--marriages, baptisms, family feasts--become an inextricable part of the background for explicitly depicted murders by shotgun, garrote, machine gun and booby-trapped automobile. The film is about an empire run from a dark, suburban Tudor palace where people, in siege, eat out of cardboard containers while babies cry and get under foot. It is also more than a little disturbing to realize that characters, who are so moving one minute, are likely, in the next scene, to be blowing out the brains of a competitor over a white tablecloth. It\\'s nothing personal, just their way of doing business as usual.\\nTHE GODFATHER\\nMarlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri.\\nDirected by Francis Ford Coppola; screenplay by Mario Puzo and Mr. Coppola, based on the novel by Mr. Puzo; director of photography, Gordon Willis; editors, William Reynolds and Peter Zinner; music composed by Nino Rota; produced by Albert S.

McGURK The Cincinnati Enquirer There's nothing like a quarter century's perspective to clear away the haze of fashion. Time filters out the forgettable; only the superior stands up to age. Few films have stood - and grown in stature - - - - - - - - - - like The Godfather. Francis Ford Coppola's translation of the Mario Puzo best seller was a sensation when it was new in 1972, becoming the first movie to make $1 million a day at the box office.\\nWith its two sequels, it has earned almost $1 billion worldwide. The film's 25th anniversary reissue with crisp new prints and remastered sound has inspired a Get The slew of tributes. More importantly, The Godfather is winning a new generation of fans who are seeing it properly - in a theater on a big screen - for the first time. The saga of the Corleone family is, superficially, a gangster movie. But under Mr.\\nCoppola's passionate guidance, it achieves the tragic grand opera. The story recounts the drive by an aged Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) to hand over to his sons the wealth and power acquired through a life of crime, without passing along the stigma of the hoodlum. He wants the family - especially his youngest son Michael emotion and dramatic sweep of (Al Pacino) - to leave the underworld behind and find its place in the world of legitimate business and politics. But redemption is an illusion. The violent heritage of Don Corleone's life haunts Michael, bringing destruction and betrayal.\\nIn the end, Michael has preserved his to Water Best Deal Works MOVIE REVIEW The Godfather **** (R; violence, language) Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire.

Showcase Cinemas Western Hills. father's empire but he loses his family and his soul.\\nMr. Coppola's striking visual interpretation - Don Corleone playing with his grandson in the garden, the ambush of Sonny Corleone (James Caan) in a car at a tollbooth, a baptism intercut with a wave of assassinations - assured the film an indelible spot in the nation's collective memory. Mr. Coppola also evoked inspired performances from virtually every cast member; it's possible to argue that neither Mr. Brando, Mr.\\nPacino, Robert Duvall nor Diane Keaton has ever done better work than in The Godfather. The re-issued version is opening only at Showcase Cinemas Western Hills, which is fitted with the chain's most up-to-date sound and projection equipment.

The daring director once had such a grasp on subtle character interaction that in this movie a mob enforcer explaining his tomato paste recipe is captivating.\\nWhat happened to that guy and who is this fella that bangs out cheeze-Louise fare like \"Jack\"?\\nAt the premiere party for \"Jack\", Coppola told me, in an exasperated voice like he was tired of defending his softer efforts, that he \"wanted to do something that wasn\\'t a lot of people getting shot.\" Admirable. Ten out of ten for social responsibility. But Francis, buddy, the stuff you did with guns has so much soul.\\nThe performances Coppola got out of these young actors (Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire), whose careers were sent into orbit by this film, are extraordinary. We understand their every glance, their every thought, as their lives and their livelihood revolve around the inescapable influence of Don Corleone (Marlon Brando), the family patriarch and head of a powerful 1940s Mafia organization.\\nWe become deeply involved in war hero and first son Michael Corleone (Pachino) and his struggle between virtue, loyalty and revenge after his father is gunned down.\\nWhen he opts for the later and personally takes out his family\\'s rivals, he spends many months hiding in Italy while his hot-headed brother Sonny (Caan) runs the mob.\\nAs the family business becomes mired in an eye-for-an-eye war, Michael returns to marry his long-suffering sweetheart (Keaton) and surrenders to his fate -- to take control the Corleone Mafia.\\nWhile the story, adapted by Coppola and Mario Puzo from Puzo\\'s novel, has many compelling parallel tracks -- not the least of which is how Sonny\\'s rage leads the family to tragedy on more than one occasion -- Michael\\'s dwindling determination to make his own way in the world captures the imagination.\\nThe discussions between Pachino and Brando in the family garden, as the reigns of power are slowly passed, carefully show both men\\'s doubts yet betray the underlying knowledge that the survival of the mob depends on this transition.\\nOf course there is more -- a famously chilling threat against an uncooperative movie producer, Michael\\'s secret marriage and misfortune in Sicily, the family\\'s last struggle with honor while deciding whether to move into narcotics trafficking -- but if you don\\'t know the story already, it would take far too long to explain. Just see it. If for no other reason than that it is one of the most worthy Oscar winners and an icon of American culture that deserves to be seen on the big screen as it was intended.\\nThose Oscars, by the way, were for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando) and Best Adapted Screenplay. The film was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor (Caan, Duvall and Pachino), Best Director, costumes, editing and sound (which has been re-vamped by Dolby for this 25th anniversary release).\\n\\n\\n\\nBUY IT CHEAP!\\n \"The Godfather\" collection\\n\\nOn DVD   On VHS\\nor Search for\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nSEARCH SPLICEDwire\\n \\npowered by FreeFind\\n\\n©SPLICEDwire\\nAll Rights Reserved\\nReturn to top\\nCurrent Reviews\\nSPLICEDwire Home'}, {'ReviewID': 134, 'Critic': 'Home\\nExplore the BBC\\nThis page has been archived and is no longer updated.\\nFind out more about page archiving.\\n\\n24 September 2014\\n\\nBBC Homepage\\nEntertainment\\nFilm\\n\\nMOVIES\\nHomepage\\nFilm Reviews\\nA-Z Archive\\nDVD Reviews\\nWeek-By-Week Archive\\nInterviews\\nA-Z Archive\\nContact Us\\n\\nReviewer\\'s Rating   User Rating\\nThe Godfather (1972)\\nReviewed by Neil Smith\\nUpdated 15 December 2000\\nIn \"You\\'ve Got Mail\" (1998), Tom Hanks suggests the answers to all life\\'s questions can be found in \"The Godfather\".

Caught up in the middle of a bloody gang war, Don Vito\\'s doomed quest to make his family respectable is dealt a body blow when his youngest son Michael, a decorated war hero and lawyer, is inexorably sucked into a life of murder and violence.\\nMarlon Brando was considered box office poison when he was cast as the ageing Don, and his hamster-cheek performance launched a thousand parodies (Even Brando got in on the act, mocking himself mercilessly in \"The Freshman\" (1990)).

Having viewed it more than a dozen times, I am still floored every time I see it and am reminded of what a cinematic landmark it truly is, especially when placed in context with the two sequels that followed it.\\nThe Godfather, which was based on a fictional Mafioso potboiler by Mario Puzo, is not so much about power itself, but about the transfer of power. It tells the story of the fictional Corleone family and how the family’s power moves from the aging father, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), to his youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). Power is seen as the ultimate commodity, more important than money or possessions. In this way, The Godfather is a deeply American film, because the Corleone family is a twisted mirror reflecting genuine American enterprise.\\nMichael is one of Vito’s four sons, three of blood, one adopted. Sonny (James Caan) is the eldest son, but he is too hot-tempered and unstable to lead the family. Fredo (John Cazale), the middle son, is likeable, but slow and unmotivated. And Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the Irish-German adopted son who works as the family’s attorney, could never lead the family because he is not Sicilian.\\nAt the beginning of the film, Michael is staunchly against taking part in the family’s illegal businesses. He is a hero of World War II who has gone out of his way to separate himself. After explaining to his girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), how his family operates through violence and intimidation, he responds to her stunned look by saying, “That’s my family, Kay. It’s not me.” But, as the film progresses, we realize he is only deluding himself. Michael is very much a part of the family, and he slowly begins to understand that he is the natural choice to succeed his father. Part of the film’s strength is its careful portrayal of Michael’s evolution into a cold-hearted, ruthless leader, much more dangerous than his father ever was.\\nWhat is so startling and so brilliant about The Godfather is how it effortlessly draws you into its world, which is constructed as much out of pulp magazines and gangster films from the ’30s as it is from authentic Italian-American experiences. From the first frames inside Don Corelone’s dark, amber-hued office, the viewer is immersed in the ebb and flow of the Mafia life, with all its stark melodrama and sudden violence. The film never ventures outside this frame of reference, so we are never allowed to identify with anyone except the Corleones. By doing this, Coppola makes them accessible and understandable, even tragic and sometimes noble. Otherwise, they would simply be power-hungry liars and murderers.\\nAt the center of the Corleone family is the Marlon Brando character. Brando brings an incredible amount of wisdom, respectability, and honor to Vito Coreleone. He is the patriarch of the most powerful family in New York, but he is not above the simple aspects of life. He is first and foremost a father who takes great pride in his family, something many “legitimate” men can’t claim. “A man who doesn’t spend time with his family can never be a real man,” he says, showing how his power is supported by a morality that many upright Americans are lacking.\\nHe doesn’t mind dealing in gambling and prostitution because he sees those as simple vices that society can accept. But, when given the chance to get into the narcotics business, he senses the decay it will bring. He refuses to go along, thus touching off a 10-year war that engulfs most of the film. The narcotics dealers, led by Sollozzo (Al Lettieri), think the old man is losing his edge, when in fact he is just trying to hold on to the old morality that most of America was beginning to discard in the postwar years.\\nThis morality is key to The Godfather because it helps the viewer identify and sympathize with the family. The family is always of the utmost importance, the emphasis being on the group, rather than the individual. When Fredo makes the mistake of arguing with Michael in front of others, Michael pulls him aside and gravely tells him, “Don’t ever take sides against the family again.” That is the ultimate sin.\\nArguments have been made as to who is the protagonist of the story, Vito or Michael. In my eyes, they are both the protagonists, with the power exchange being the link between them. The first half of the film deals with Vito while he is in power, and the second half details Michael’s rise, with the final frames of the film ensuring us that he is now the Godfather for the next generation.\\nThe greatest sequence, which cuts together quiet scenes of Michael standing godfather to his sister’s child with the brutal violence of his henchmen murdering all the family’s enemies is a masterpiece of both editing and storytelling. The two opposing halves of the sequence show Michael’s dual nature: In the legitimate sense, he is becoming godfather to a child, a highly respected and religious position. But, in a larger sense, by ordering the murder of all his enemies, he confirms his position as head of the Corleone family--the new Godfather.\\nA riveting film from beginning to end, The Godfather is a landmark in American cinema. At its heart, it is simply great storytelling. All the elements are there, from Gordon Willis’s superb cinematography to Nino Rota’s haunting score. For three hours it draws you into its world, bringing complex characters to life and letting the drama unfold slowly and surely. It is an excellent depiction of the inherent, all-encompassing dangers of power and its ability to corrupt. Time has not diminished this masterpiece, but rather solidified what critics and audiences alike knew when it was first released: This is one of the greatest motion pictures ever made.\\nThe Godfather Trilogy 50th Anniversary 4K UHD Box Set\\nAspect Ratio 1.85:1 (all three films)\\nAudio\\nThe Godfather 4K\\nEnglish Dolby TrueHD 5.1 surround\\nEnglish Dolby Digital 2.0 monaural\\nSpanish Dolby Digital 5.1 surround\\nFrench Dolby Digital 5.1 surround\\nFrench Dolby Digital 2.0 monaural\\nItalian Dolby Digital 5. surround\\nItalian Dolby Digital 2.0 monaural\\nJapanese Dolby Digital 2.0 monaural\\nPortuguese Dolby Digital 5.1 surround\\nThe Godfather: Part II 4K\\nEnglish Dolby TrueHD 5.1 surround\\nEnglish Dolby Digital 2.0 monaural\\nSpanish Dolby Digital 5.1 surround\\nFrench Dolby Digital 5.1 surround\\nFrench Dolby Digital 2.0 monaural\\nJapanese Dolby Digital 5.1 surround\\nJapanese Dolby Digital 2.0 monaural\\nThe Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone 4K\\nEnglish Dolby TrueHD 5.1 surround\\nCzech Dolby Digital 5.1 surround\\nGerman Dolby Digital 5.1 surround\\nSpanish Dolby Digital 5.1 surround\\nSpanish Dolby Digital 5.1 surround\\nFrench Dolby Digital 5.1 surround\\nItalian Dolby Digital 5.1 surround\\nJapanese Dolby Digital 5.1 surround\\nPolish Dolby Digital 2.0 monaural\\nPortuguese Dolby Digital 5.1 surround\\nRussian Dolby Digital 5.1 surround\\nThe Godfather Part III 4K\\nEnglish Dolby TrueHD 5.1 surround\\nGerman Dolby Digital 5.1 surround\\nSpanish Dolby Digital 5.1 surround\\nSpanish Dolby Digital 5.1 surround\\nFrench Dolby Digital 5.1 surround\\nItalian Dolby Digital 5.1 surround\\nJapanese Dolby Digital 5.1 surround\\nPortuguese Dolby Digital 5.1 surround\\nRussian Dolby Digital 5.1 surround\\nSubtitles The Godfather 4K: English, English SDH, French, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish; The Godfather Part II 4K: English, English SDH, French, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish; The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone 4K:English, English SDH, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, Cantonese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Korean, Mandarin (Simplified), Mandarin (Traditional), Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Swedish, Thai; The Godfather Part III 4K: English, English SDH, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, Cantonese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Korean, Mandarin (Simplified), Mandarin (Traditional), Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Swedish, Thai\\nSupplements\\nAudio commentary on all three films by director Francis Ford Coppola\\nVideo introduction by Coppola\\n“Full Circle: Preserving The Godfather”\\n“Capturing the Corleones: Through the Lens of Photographer Steve Schapiro” featurette\\n“The Godfather: Home Movies” featurette\\n“Restoration Comparisons” featurettes\\n“The Masterpiece That Almost Wasn’t” featurette\\n“Godfather World” featurette\\n“Emulsion Rescue: Revealing The Godfather” featurette\\n“...When the Shooting Stopped” featurette\\n“The Godfather on the Red Carpet” featurette\\nFour Short Films on The Godfather\\nThe Corleone Family Tree\\nCrime Organization Chart\\nConnie and Carlo's Wedding Album\\nThe Godfather Family: A Look Inside retrospective documentary\\n“The Godfather Behind the Scenes” 1971 featurette\\nAdditional scenes\\nTrailers\\nGalleries\\nGodfather Chronology\\nJames Caan Screen Test\\nThe Sopranos\\nPuzo “For the Money”\\nThe Godfather Around the World\\nCosa Nostra & Coppola\\nThe Filmmakers: Francis Ford Coppola, Mario Puzo, Gordon Willis, Dean Tavoularis, Nino Rota, Carmine Coppola\\nDistributor Paramount Home Entertainment\\nRelease Date March 22, 2022\\nCOMMENTS\\nHaving reviewed DVDs, Blu-rays, and now 4K UHDs, I recognize that there are times when I get it wrong. To wit, here is a sentence from my review of the Robert A. Harris-led restoration of The Godfather trilogy that was released on Blu-ray in 2008: “this new digital restoration … seems to have brought the films as close as they will ever come to how they looked theatrically.” Well, I was wrong, and I am happy to say so in light of Paramount’s truly stunning new 4K boxset, which features all-new restorations that benefit not only from the increased resolution and color that 2160p/Dolby Vision offers, but also the discovery in the ensuing years of additional and better film elements for the transfers. As detailed in the supplements, the restoration and archival teams at Paramount and American Zoetrope painstakingly pieced together all of the best known surviving elements to create all-new transfers that noticeable improve upon the previous restoration (which is rightfully commended as the foundation upon which this one could be built). The image boasts demonstrably better detail, which we can see, for example, in Connie’s wedding dress, which used to be mostly blown-out whites, but now has visible lace patterning. The image is still fairly heavy with grain and slightly soft, but the grain is much finer and less noticeable, which also enhances minute details throughout (the general softness is the intended look and any attempt to sharpen it would be disastrous). Colors also get a significant boost, giving the films a more natural palette of strong reds and blues to complement the blacks and earth tones, rather than reds that are a bit orangey and blues that lean toward teal. Thousands of hours were also spent repairing dirt, nicks, tears, and splices, leaving the films all but pristine. Obviously The Godfather, being the oldest of the films and the one whose original 35mm negative took the most abuse, benefits the most from the restoration, but Part II also looks demonstrably better in all those categories, as well. All three films were shot by cinematographer Gordon Willis, which gives them a visual consistency despite spanning 18 years of production. The image on The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corelone is mostly likely just the full 4K presentation of the transfer of the new re-edit that we got on an individual Blu-ray release last year. These are films of dark shadows, heavy contrast, and golden lighting, and the 4K transfers are truly gorgeous, with deep, rich, warm imagery that is alive with grain and texture, making the experience of watching them again feel that much more rewarding. The soundtracks for the films appear to be the same Dolby Digital True HD 5.1 surround remasters we got on the 2008 Blu-ray set. The forlorn horns that greet us at the beginning of each movie have exquisite depth and resonance, as does all of the music. The first two films, both originally recorded in monaural, are necessarily limited to an extent, with most of the soundtrack coming from the center speaker. Gunshots and explosions are given added impact, and directionality and imaging are used sparingly but effectively, with only a few instances sounding forced.\\nThe supplements are extensive, drawing together almost everything that was included in the original 2001 DVD set and the 2008 Blu-ray set and then adding several new supplements. All of the supplements, with the exception of the audio commentaries, are housed on a separate Blu-ray disc, which is convenient. I should also note that the original theatrical cut of The Godfather Part III is included on a 4K UHD disc in the same case with the supplements disc, which is appropriate since Coppola now views The Godfather Coda as the true third film. However, it is nice for us completists that the original theatrical cut is not only included in the boxset, but has been given first-rate 4K UHD treatment.\\nFirst, the new stuff: We can lead off with the 16-minute featurette “Full Circle: Preserving The Godfather,” which focuses on the new restoration of the film. It includes interviews with numerous archivists and restoration experts and gives us a fascinating glimpse into the work that was done to create this new release. “Capturing the Corleones: Through the Lens of Photographer Steve Schapiro” is a new 13-minute featurette in which set photographer Steve Schapiro reminisces about his time documenting the production. “The Godfather: Home Movies” consists of 9 minutes of silent 8mm footage shot on set during the production of the opening wedding scene. And, finally, there are about 10 minutes of visual comparisons of The Godfather and The Godfather Part II that demonstrate how substantial the difference is between this new restoration and the one from 2007.\\nFrom the 2008 Blu-ray set, we have two featurettes: “The Masterpiece That Almost Wasn’t” (29 min.) and “Godfather World” (11 min.), which feature interviews with an impressive list of people who were either involved in making the films or have been somehow affected or influenced by them. The former category includes director Francis Ford Coppola, editor Walter Murch, then-Paramount vice president Peter Bart, and then-senior vice president Robert Evans, and the latter category includes everyone from Coppola friends and fellow New Hollywood luminaries George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and William Friedkin, to directors Kimberly Peirce and Guillermo del Toro, Sopranos creator David Chase, films critics Kenneth Turan and Mick LaSalle, South Park co-creator Trey Parker, and actors Joe Mantegna, Jon Turturro, and Alec Baldwin. “The Masterpiece That Almost Wasn’t” explores the film’s conflicted production history and how it came close to never making it into production, while “Godfather World” is an intriguing and often amusing look into the films’ vast cultural impact. It focuses a great deal on how they influenced The Sopranos, but we also get clips of hilarious Godfather parodies from The Simpsons, South Park, Family Guy, and SCTV (as well as that infamous Audi commercial), plus clips from Seth Isler’s amazing one-man stage-show The Godfadda Workout, in which he recreates much of the film playing all the roles himself. More information about the film’s actual production can be gleaned from “…When the Shooting Stopped,” a 15-minute look at the film’s postproduction with particular emphasis paid to the film’s score.\\nThose interested in the films’ difficult 2007 restoration will enjoy “Emulsional Rescue,” an in-depth 19-minute look at how the badly damaged original negatives were scanned at 4K by Motion Picture Imaging and restored. We get some great behind-the-scenes footage of the lab work taking place, as well as interviews with restoration expert Robert A. Harris; cinematographer Gordon Willis, who shot all three films, and Allen Daviau, who served as consulting cinematographer for the restoration; Martin Cohen, executive vice president for postproduction at Paramount who oversaw the restoration; and a host of digital artists who made the work happen.\\nAfter that the supplements start to get a bit thin. “Godfather on the Red Carpet” is simply four minutes of various actors gushing about the film on the red carpet for the premiere of Cloverfield (there was no small amount of Paramount synergy at work here, especially with the presence of so many of the actors from the then-upcoming Star Trek reboot). “Four Short Films About The Godfather,” which run 7 minutes total, feel like outtakes from the longer featurettes that didn’t naturally fit anywhere (these include debates over which is better, The Godfather or The Godfather Part II and Coppola explaining why Clemenza’s death is a bit fuzzy in the second film). The Corleone Family Tree and Crime Organization Chart are pretty cool interactive features that give a fairly ridiculous amount of information about the characters and the actors who played them (if you’ve ever wanted to see Sonny’s rap sheet, this is for you). Finally, there is “Connie & Carlo’s Wedding Album,” which is stills gallery of 25 photos from the opening wedding sequence.\\nAlso included is the entire archive of supplements from the 2001 DVD box set. First up is director Francis Ford Coppola’s commentary—actually, his commentaries. Coppola fills an entire commentary track for each of the three films, and they are all outstanding. Perhaps it is because Coppola is such an experienced and knowledgeable director; perhaps it is because the films themselves are so deep and rich in meaning and history; or perhaps it is because Coppola had so many years to sit back and reflect on his achievements and failures. Most likely, it is a combination of all three, but whatever the reasons, these commentaries are definitely worth listening to, especially the one for Part III in which Coppola discusses the less-than-enthusiastic response to the film and offers a defense of it.\\nThe Godfather Family: A Look Inside is a 73-minute retrospective documentary produced by Paramount in 1991 after the completion of Part III. It includes numerous interviews with those involved, including Coppola, novelist/screenwriter Mario Puzo, producer Fred Roos, and actors Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall, among others. Most intriguing, though, is the inclusion of numerous screen tests conducted for the first film, including tests of James Caan and Martin Sheen playing the role of Michael Corleone. The behind-the-scenes supplements include six featurettes. The first, “Francis Ford Coppola’s Notebook,” is a 10-minute interview with Coppola in which he discusses an enormous “prompt book,” which he describes as a “multi-layered roadmap” that he used to plan the film down to the smallest detail. “Music of The Godfather” contains two sections, a five-and-a-half minute recording of a meeting in 1972 between Coppola and composer Nino Rota in which Rota plays for Coppola the famous waltz music for the first time. The second part is a three-minute interview with composer Carmine Coppola (Francis’s father) filmed while Part III was being scored. “On Location” is an interesting bit in which production designer Dean Tavoularis returns to the street on the lower East Side of Manhattan that was literally transformed for Part II. This featurette includes still images from the production as well as an extensive bit of black-and-white footage from a documentary shot during Part II‘s production. “Coppola and Puzo on Screenwriting” consists of eight minutes of interviews with Coppola and the late Mario Puzo on how they collaborated to write the three films. There are a few interesting bits here, including Puzo’s dislike of Coppola’s decision to have Michael order Fredo’s murder at the end of Part II and his desire to make a Part IV that would focus on Sonny during the 1930s. The last featurette, “Gordon Willis on Cinematography,” is actually an excerpt from the excellent documentary Visions of Light, coproduced by the American Film Institute. Also featuring interviews from noted cinematographers Michael Chapman, Conrad Hall, and William A. Fraker, this featurette is a crash course on The Godfather‘s visual style and the great risks Willis took in making it look the way it does.\\nAlso included is a nine-minute promotional featurette on The Godfather produced in 1971. Presented in scratchy, faded full-frame, it offers little insight into the film itself although it is interesting as an example of how Paramount was trying to position the film during its theatrical release. Additional supplements include an astounding 34 deleted scenes, many of which long-time Godfather fans will recognize as having been included in the re-edited 1977 The Godfather Saga, which cut together the first two films in chronological order. A number of the scenes, however, had not been seen before. The extra scenes are organized chronologically by year as the would appear within the entire saga, and each is preceded by a brief description of the scene and how it would fit into the larger narrative.\\nThere are also a number of storyboards from Part II and Part III, an extensive stills gallery of production and behind-the-scenes shots, the Corleone family tree with personal histories of all the major characters, a timeline of events in all three films, archival TV footage of Coppola and others accepting their Oscars in both 1973 and 1975, and theatrical trailers for all three films presented in anamorphic widescreen.\\nCopyright © 2022 James Kendrick\\nThoughts?

The 1972 Best Picture Oscar winner is a great pulp drama co-authored for the screen by Coppola and novelist Mario Puzo (the script also won an Oscar). And all the while, we think we're watching a Mafia crime story but we're actually watching one of the great American family melodramas. The casting is nothing to sneeze at either with Marlon Brando delivering one of the signature performances of his career (he, too, won an Oscar) and the very young Al Pacino seizing his screen destiny. So many great roles and characters in this movie and then there's that eternally haunting Nino Rota score. As for the storytellng, The Godfather is an intricately constructed gem that simultaneously kicks ass. As for Gordon Willis' celebrated cinematography, let me just say that if you've only seen this dark atmospheric stuff on TV, you owe yourself the revelation of seeing it in a theatre. It's an offer you can't refuse.\\nSHOWTIMES\\nAFS Cinema\\n6406 N.

More often, it’s the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of “The Godfather,” which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what’s left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThe remarkable thing about Mario Puzo’s novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn’t give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.\\nThe movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone’s family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n“The Godfather” himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father’s position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather’s role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.\\nThose who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nBut Brando’s performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whispery, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.\\nThe rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although “The Godfather” is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn’t time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he’ll have to cancel his day at the races).\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nThe success of “The Godfather” as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn’t miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone’s daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garrotings.\\nCoppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so “The Godfather” becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they’d tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn’t have worked. But it’s uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish-brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nAlthough the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can’t quite understand unless you’ve read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other.\\nDRAMA\\nCRIME\\nACTION\\nRoger Ebert\\nRoger Ebert was the film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times from 1967 until his death in 2013.

Donald Wildmon’s organization) has this to say in its FAQ:\\nAFA believes that the entertainment industry… has played a major role in the decline of those values on which our country was founded and which keep a society and its families strong and healthy…. We believe in holding accountable the companies which sponsor programs attacking traditional family values.\\nWhat would the AFA have to say about The Godfather? Francis Ford Coppola’s riveting generational saga of Sicilian mob families in New York City is steeped in themes like loyalty to family and the importance of religion, and at the same time demonstrates how dangerous too-close family ties can be.\\nDon Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando, whose iconic performance has overshadowed an even better turn by Al Pacino as his son Michael) is a man for whom family is all. “A man who doesn’t spend time with his family can never be a real man,” he says, and he lives by that. He’s devoted to his wife, dotes on his children and grandchildren, throws a lavish wedding for his daughter, and kills or threatens anyone who gets in his way or that of his family and friends. His sons are all in the family business, which includes union racketeering and gambling.\\nAll his sons but Michael, that is, the black sheep of the family (or perhaps that should be “white sheep”). A returning war hero as the film opens in the postwar 40s, he has always distanced himself from the family business. But in a time of family need, his fierce loyalty to his father sucks him into the underworld he’s tried to stay out of. Over The Godfather’s three-hour running time, the story of Michael’s transformation from a “civilian” in a mob family into its hard-nosed general never flags.\\nIs this a film that Donald Wildmon would let his kids watch? After all, Vito Corleone swears “on the souls of my grandchildren”; his position as godfather to many children is looked upon so highly that that becomes his revered title. Those would be good things, wouldn’t they? When Vito’s sons want to move the family into the narcotics business — “a thing of the future,” the family lawyer advises — Vito objects: Drugs are dirty and dangerous. And it’s not just Vito who feels that way — a rival don doesn’t want drugs anywhere near schools and won’t sell to kids. Just say no, no?\\nOf course, there are all the murders and the beatings and the general mayhem that the Corleones and their rivals wreak. But I guess that just goes to show that maybe the much-vaunted “family values” aren’t quite the solution for the problems that ail us.\\nOscars Best Picture 1972\\nAFI 100 (1998 list): #2\\nunforgettable movie moment:\\nA movie producer who refuses a “favor” for Don Corleone wakes up to find the severed head of his beloved — and expensive — racehorse in the bed with him.\\nprevious Best Picture:\\n1971: The French Connection\\nnext Best Picture:\\n1973: The Sting\\nprevious AFI 100 film:\\n1.

If I read correctly, your argument is: Don Wildmon preaches family values. Don Corleone preaches family values. Don Corleone is also a murderer, extortionist & racketeer. Therefore, Don Wildmon is bad.\\nYou could also argue that Don Wildmon is bad because everyone addresses him as “Don”… just like “Don Corleone!” Sound logical?\\n[originally posted to FlickFilosopher.com 11.28.00]\\n0\\nD\\nLee Taggart\\nreply to \\nEe B Galbraith\\nSun, Apr 10, 2022 6:44pm\\nFalse. Her point is that unlike Don Wildmon’s manifesto implies, family values are NOT all that matter. There are a lot of other important things to consider which his organization does not seem to deem necessary to consider.\\n0\\n  watch at home\\nUS/Canada\\n\\nAmazon US dvd/blu\\nPrime Video US\\nApple TV US\\nAmazon Canada dvd/blu\\nApple TV Canada\\n\\n\\nUK\\n\\nAmazon UK dvd/blu\\nPrime Video UK\\nApple TV UK\\nlisten\\n\\nAmazon US\\nApple Music US\\nAmazon Canada\\nApple Music Canada\\nAmazon UK\\nApple Music UK\\nread\\n\\nAmazon US\\nApple Books US\\nAmazon Canada\\nApple Books Canada\\nAmazon UK\\nApple Books UK\\nWhen you purchase or rent almost anything from Amazon US, Amazon Canada, Amazon UK, and Apple TV, Books, and Music (globally), I get a small affiliate fee that helps support my work.

Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all \"gangster movies\" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If a film is about Jewish mobsters, it\\'s a \"Jewish Godfather\"; if it\\'s about the Chinese underworld, it\\'s an \"Oriental Godfather\"; if it takes place in contemporary times, it\\'s a \"modern day Godfather.\"\\nIf The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.\\nRarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather\\'s success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola\\'s film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it.\\nThe film opens in the study of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Godfather, who is holding court. It is the wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request on that day. So the supplicants come, each wanting something different - revenge, a husband for their daughter, a part in a movie.\\nThe family has gathered for the event. Michael (Al Pacino), Don Vito\\'s youngest son and a second world war hero, is back home in the company of a new girlfriend (Diane Keaton). The two older boys, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there as well, along with their \"adopted\" brother, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the don\\'s right-hand man.\\nWith the end of the war, the times are changing, and as much as Don Vito seems in control at the wedding, his power is beginning to erode. By the standards of some, his views on the importance of family, loyalty, and respect are antiquated. Even his heir apparent, Sonny, disagrees with his refusal to get into the drug business. Gambling and alcohol are forces of the past and present; narcotics are the future. But Don Vito will not compromise, even when a powerful drug supplier named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) arrives with promises of high profits for those who back him.\\nDon Vito\\'s refusal to do business with Sollozzo strikes the first sparks of a war that will last for years and cost many lives. Each of the five major mob families in New York will be gouged by the bloodshed, and a new order will emerge. Betrayals will take place, and the Corleone family will be shaken to its roots by treachery from both within and without.\\nThe Corleone with the most screen time is Michael (it\\'s therefore odd that Al Pacino received a Best Supporting Actor nomination), and his tale, because of its scope and breadth, is marginally dominant. His transformation from \"innocent\" bystander to central manipulator is the stuff of a Shakespearean tragedy. By the end, this man who claimed to be different from the rest of his family has become more ruthless than Don Vito ever was.\\nDespite the likes of Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, Scarface, ...And Justice for All, and Scent of a Woman on his resume, Pacino is best remembered for the role he created in The Godfather (and subsequently reprised in two sequels). While this is not his most demonstrative performance - indeed, he is exceptionally restrained - the quality of the script makes Michael Corleone notable.\\nNext to Humphrey Bogart\\'s Rick from Casablanca, Oscar winner Marlon Brando\\'s Don Vito may be the most imitated character in screen history. The line \"I\\'m gonna make him an offer he can\\'t refuse\" has attained legendary status, as has the entire performance. With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando has created a personae that will be recalled for as long as motion pictures exist.\\nDon Vito is a most complicated gangster. In his own words, he is not a killer, and he never mixes business with personal matters. He puts family first (\"A man who doesn\\'t spend time with his family can never be a real man\") and despises displays of weakness. He understands the burden of power, and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the \"throne\", is one of The Godfather\\'s most revealing moments (about both father and son).\\nThe Godfather had three Best Supporting Actor nominees, all well-deserved. The first was Pacino (who probably should have been nominated alongside Brando in the Best Actor category). The other two were James Caan and Robert Duvall. In a way, it\\'s surprising that Duvall wasn\\'t passed over. His presence in The Godfather isn\\'t flashy or attention-arresting. Like his character of Tom Hagen, he is steady, reliable, and stays in the background. Not so for Caan\\'s Sonny, whose demonstrative and volatile personality can\\'t be overlooked.\\nFamily responsibility. A father\\'s legacy. The need to earn respect. The corrupting influence of power. These are some of the ingredients combined in Francis Ford Coppola\\'s cinematic blender. They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries.\\nAlthough the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York\\'s Italian crime families. The word \"Mafia\" conjures up images of the sinister and mysterious - scenes of the sort where Luca Brasi meets his fate. Francis Ford Coppola has tapped into this fascination and woven it as yet another element of the many that make his motion picture a compelling experience.\\nWe come to The Godfather like Kay Adams - outsiders uncertain in our expectations - but it doesn\\'t take long for us to be captivated by this intricate, violent world. The film can be viewed on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who demand much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but it is one-hundred seventy minutes well-spent. When the closing credits roll, only a portion of the story has been told. Yet that last haunting image (Kay\\'s shock of recognition), coupled with Nino Rota\\'s mournful score, leaves a crater-like impression that The Godfather Part II only deepens.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGodfather, The (United States, 1972)\\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola\\nCast: Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Al Lettieri, Sterling Hayden, John Cazale\\nScreenplay: Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo based on the novel by Mario Puzo\\nCinematography: Gordon Willis\\nMusic: Nino Rota\\nU.S. Distributor: Paramount Pictures\\nRanked #6 in Berardinelli\\'s Top 100\\nRun Time: 2:51\\nU.S. Release Date: 1972-03-24\\nMPAA Rating: \"R\" (Violence, Profanity, Sexual Situations, Nudity)\\nGenre: DRAMA\\nSubtitles: none\\nTheatrical Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1\\nComments\\nAdd Comment\\nEllen Fox 2023 06 06, 20:04\\nReply to this comment\\nHello Readers, I personally advocate hackman for any type of hacking services.\\nfor the past few months i suspected my husband was cheating on me and I noticed he would always hide and lock his phone.\\nhe would even answer phone calls secretly.
