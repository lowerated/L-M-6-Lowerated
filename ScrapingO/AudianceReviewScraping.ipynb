It’s not as common as a nice picture or a film that was well made yet doesn’t sit atop the pile of discs or streamer options for a revisit. Some sets are best seen once, before being broken down and discarded in your head. So if Schindler’s List is at the top of the “hard to rewatch” stack, The Shawshank Redemption is at the other end of the spectrum. It’s a “stop what you’re doing and watch the rest” kind of flick.\\nThis much was confirmed when I saw it on the big screen this past week for the first time in decades. Every scene I saw coming, but the impact was still strong and emotional enough to make an impact that felt fresh somehow. Frank Darabont’s adaptation of Stephen King’s novel demands your attention, whether it’s catching the final 45 minutes on TBS or being able to go through the whole thing. Thursday night at Galleria 6 Cinemas, it was a date with the big screen.\\nShawshank may not be at the top of the list for old movies to see on the biggest screen possible again. After all, it’s a movie that can be adored from anywhere on any sized screen. However, the big screen brings back a lot of memories, taking you back to that movie theater that saw you shake hands with a film for the first time.\\nGet more from Dan Buffa in the Substack app\\nAvailable for iOS and Android\\nGet the app\\nAs in the first time I saw and fell in love with the final scene with Morgan Freeman’s Red and Tim Robbins’ Andy by the Pacific ocean. The camera panning back as the two men, prison inmates turned best friends, embrace after time apart. One of them escaped while the other one got out after 40 years, colliding by the water in a retirement endeavor that won’t involve crawling through 500 yards of shit. Seeing that on the big screen is a difference maker, a reason to go out and experience that feeling again.\\nShawshank’s specialty was making a prison movie, something that could be dire and depressing in another filmmaker’s hands, into a Cheers type of atmosphere with friends who knew each other for years… behind bars. But Darabont also cut right to the heart of a flock of human birds trapped in a giant cage, under the watch of a corrupt warden and terrifyingly sinister guard. It was serious, certain, and made you laugh. That’s a mix that swallows most directors whole when only given a single movie to produce lightning in a bottle.\\nShawshank is where audiences first met the uber-talented Clancy Brown, who embodied the fearsome Captain Hadley, and Bob Gunton, who delivered cinema fans one of the hardest warden nuts to crack. James Whitmore’s lovable Brooks, William Sadler’s Hank Williams loving Heywood, and Gil Bellows’ ill-fated Tommy. The list goes on and on, including Freeman’s son Alfonso, who plays Red in the young photos.\\nFreeman owns the film. Robbins is always a trusted presence and imbues Andy with the willpower that viewers need to clamp to for the running time, but Red is the safe vessel that your heart will cling to while the horrors and misery of a life behind bars can do to a man. While the actor had made a mark before the release of this movie, this is where Freeman stepped into a completely different sphere of actors. Anyone who watched The Shawshank Redemption loved Red to pieces, including me.\\nThe voice was born here, lending King’s narration a few extra ounces of gravitas. We felt what Freeman’s felon felt, the regret and sadness that comes with a life that suddenly hangs on one poor decision for four decades. It’s the acting that made audiences feel the sheer power in that final oceanside scene.\\nThomas Newman’s score remains a paramount for dramas, the curiosity of his musical arrangements matching with heartfelt notes that always seem to include a piano. A movie can ascend based on its sound and music, and Newman helped Darabont’s shots land in the net. Find a country road with only two lanes, get into a car with this soundtrack playing, and forget about your GPS.\\nThe Shawshank Redemption isn’t just another Oscar-nominated, beloved movie. It’s the absolute example of a rewatchable gem. It plays Sunday at Galleria 6 Cinemas at 1pm, its final showing of the week. If there’s a fine excuse to get out of the windy breeze and let the brunch food settle, it’s 150 minutes with Red and Andy and friends.\\nNext month, the Back on the Big Screen throwback selection will be Ron Shelton’s Bull Durham! The best baseball movie will grace Galleria’s big screen in May. I’ll have more on the showtimes, reasons why it’s Kevin Costner’s finest role, and more in the coming weeks.

Bandit Queen. written by Mala Sen, opens with the bald statement \"This is a true story\" - with none of the leeway that \"based on\" would allow. Still, true or not - and the person whose history it purports to tell. Phoolan Devi.\\nrejects it - the story is hard to follow. In one scene. for instance. Phoolan\\'s lover. Vikram.\\nis wounded in the river Chambal. It\\'s a wound that will need a city doctor. butwe don\\'t see how the couple travel. There\\'s simply a cut to Kaipur city and a doctor examining Vikram\\'s wound. But then the doctor leaves - the flat we see is not his but Phoolan\\'s and Vikram\\'s.\\nSo what are we supposed to imagine? Apparently, that Phoolan and Vikram travel by some dreamlike means to the city. find themselves Adam Marsaccommodation and then locate a doctor who makes house calls - a bizarrely offhand approach to emergency medical treatment. Other scenes are easy to follow as narratives, but puzzling in their point of view. Phoolan and Vikram. in whose company she has learnt to overcome the trauma of abuse, track down her husband of long ago and take revenge on him.\\nAre we supposed to notice that this is not a deep-laid plan, but an impulsive response? When Phoolan visits her parents and introduces them to Vikram, her father says,\" You should be with your husband.\" Her reply is, in effect, I\\'ll go to my husband all right. You\\'ll see! She is taking revenge in a displaced way on her father, who, after all. agreed to the arranged marriage. The psychological muddying of this scene is the more damaging since it marks the point where Phoolan Devi stops being a standard bandit, remarkable for her gender, and becomes an equivocal avenger of her caste and her sex. The punishing of the husband is long, drawn-out and perhaps fatal: at one point it seems to be carried out in view of the on Bandit Queen whole village, at another it becomes almost a sadistic ritual.\\nAfterwards. at any rate. Vikram says: \"I haven\\'t seen that side of you.\" And it doesn\\'t sound like a reproach. It\\'s also a problem that Vikram (Nirmal Pandey), Clyde to Phoolan\\'s Bonnie, handsome. tender and.\\nfor a bandit. -feminist (\"I don\\'t people, I win their respect, even women\") is so ideal as to seem like a parody of a wishfulfilment fantasy.

She may steal a necklace from a jeweller\\'s.\\nask a passing girl her name and whether she\\'d like to join the gang, and then, when the child\\'s mother starts to snatch her away, give her the necklace to wear on her wedding day. Public lawbreaking seems to be a form of regression therapy for her, creating a space where she can repair the past in fantasy. The director, Shekhar Kapur, tries to put us inside Phoolan\\'s head when, in a sense, we least need to be there. When he shows us her most infamous exploit, the Behmai massacre. he bleaches and The Shawshank Redemption played times by Tim in the Robbins, is of raped his many early part incarceration by a group of the image and uses slow-motion isn\\'t, at 143 minutes, a short inmates known as \"the sisters\".\\nto suggest that she is over- film.

The solid accomplishment of Frank Darabont\\'s directing debut, with its seasoned sense of pacing and place, comes as something of a revelation. But the success of \"The Shawshank Redemption\" should really be no surprise, because this harrowing, terrifying, yet humanistic tale of men behind bars comes from the same company that established itself with the film based on King\\'s novella \"The Body.\" That moving, finely drawn story of a man looking back with regret at the lost friendships of his boyhood, and a day of terrible discovery, gave Rob Reiner\\'s film company its name, Castle Rock Productions, borrowed from the fictitious settings of many King works. And, like \"Stand by Me,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption\" (originally called \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\") comes from a collection of four pieces, the 1982 \"Different Seasons.\" With or without Rita Hayworth, the film\\'s title requires some explanation. Shawshank is the name of the maximum-security prison in King\\'s home state of Maine (though the film was made in the abandoned Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, a grim, gray Victorian stone pile.\\nRedemption refers to the experience of the film\\'s central figure, the mild, boyish but unbreakable banker, Andy Dufresne, played in a subdued, brainy, oddly heroic mode by the versatile Tim Robbins. As for \\'40s pinup Hayworth, she is seen only as a poster on the wall of Andy\\'s cell. Rita Hayworth comes into Andy\\'s permanent one-room residence TTTT If v i ,ro Morgan Freeman, left, as \"Red\" Andy Dufresne deliver outstanding Shawshank Redemption.\" through the aid of his prison big brother, \"Red\" Redding, acted by the extraordinary Morgan Freeman in yet another quiet exhibition of manly, or perhaps almost godlike, strength, dignity and caring. In Shawshank, Red is the man who can get anything an inmate might want. Freeman also uses his deep, thoughtful, unmannered voice to narrate \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" beginning with the tangled night of drunkenness and murder that opens Darabont\\'s dark-hued film.\\nAs the credits roll, a whiskey-swigging Andy woozily pilots a \\'40s coupe around his hometown. The sequence ends in the double murder of Andy\\'s wife and her golf -pro lover. Darabont then cuts to a quick courtroom scene in which Andy is hit with a heavy sentence, despite his protestations of innocence. The rest of Darabont\\'s film depicts an innocent\\'s life among criminals of every stripe, some guilty but still human, some twisted into brutality. Darabont does not avoid the vicious sexual assaults by V, T \\'J i t is-- Michael Weinsteln Castle Rock Entertainment Redding and Tim Robbins as performances in \"The Film review THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, Directed and written by Frank Darabont, based on the short novel \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\" by Stephen King; director of photography, Roger Deakins; music composed by Thomas Newman; production designer, Terence Marsh; edited by Richard Francis-Bruce; produced by Niki Marvin; executive producers, Liz Glotzer and David Lester.\\nA Columbia Pictures release of a Castle Rock Entertainment presentation, opening today at Showcase Cinemas, East Hartford and Berlin.

Worse perhaps than the inmates, however, are the screws (guards) and the warden. Clancy Brown makes his rock-hard Captain Hadley the very model of a sadist who toL-nc nlaaciire in his work, and Rnh laivfa - , Gunton etches Warden Norton as a gimlet-eyed, thin-lipped, utterly corrupted figure of terrible power, happy to steal whatever he can. The evil dictatorship of the warden and his minions is contrasted with the democratic friendships between the men who surround Red Redding.\\nWilliam Sadler sketches a persuasive portrait of one of the inner circle as the slow-witted but fair-minded Heywood, and Gil Bellows gives a heartbreaking performance as Tommy, a young thief whom Andy helps educate, even as the former banker juggles the warden\\'s books. The extremes within the prison community are sharply contrasted by James Whitmore as the sweet old codger Brooks Hatlen, who runs the prison library but cannot survive on the outside, and by Mark Rolston as Bogs Diamond, the sick \"sister\" who assaults Andy. As fine as the ensemble is, however, Darabont proves equally adept at presenting the dangerous and barbarous world inside the fortress of the damned. Working with Roger Deakins as director of photography and Terence Marsh as his production designer, the neophyte director sets out a vision of prison as an unlikely place for redemption. Even Rita Hayworth or Raquel Welch cannot brighten or warm a cell within the chill, dark walls.\\nAnd in the yard, the light looks pale and thin. In Shawshank, only a man like Red can offer hope of redemption and deliverance from evil. Rated R, this film contains vulgarities, a gang sodomizing in pris- \\' on, the terrors of solitary confine-\\'. ment, the double murder that opens the picture, and other acts ol horrific violence. \\'.\\nUnited States\\nConnecticut\\nHartford\\nHartford Courant\\n1994\\nOct\\n07\\nPage 62\\nThe Shawshank Redemption\\nSubscribe\\nGift Subscriptions\\nHelp\\nSite Map\\nAbout\\nFish Wrap—Official Blog\\nAffiliates\\nContent Providers\\nUnited States (English)\\nVisit our other sites\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nInstagram\\n© 2024 Newspapers.com™ by Ancestry®.

The next thing we know, Dufresne is being tried in the murder of his wife and her lover - and despite his protestations of innocence (not to mention lack of a murder weapon), he\\'s convicted and sent to prison for life. But don\\'t look for any O.J. Simpson parallels here. Writer-director Frank Darabont\\'s first theatrical feature is not ripped from any headlines; rather, it\\'s a stirring prison drama that celebrates the transforming power of friendship, the triumph of good over adversity and, as the title suggests, the possibility of redemption.\\nHow old-fashioned and - given the current cynical state of the nation - how utterly refreshing. Based on the Stephen King novella \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,\" the film is actually a period piece that begins in the late 1940s, when Dufresne is sent to Shawshank State Prison, and continues through to the 1960s. While Dufresne is the driving force of the piece, another Shawshank inmate, Ellis Boyd Redding Yardena Arar Los Angeles Daily News (Morgan Freeman), narrates the tale. Redding, better-known as Red, is the prison \"fixer,\" the man who gets things from the outside if they can be obtained at all. He\\'s also the resident cynic, and when he first sets eyes on Dufresne, he sees him as little more than an upscale sissy.\\nBut Dufresne slowly wins the grudging respect of Red and his followers. He doesn\\'t complain, even after months and years of physical and sexual abuse (no politically correct perspective on prison homosexuality here), and he eventually trades on his financial acumen to improve conditions for inmates. However, Dufresne\\'s accounting skills become so indispensable to the prison\\'s hypocritical, scripture-quoting warden (Bob Gunton) that he cold-bloodedly eliminates an unexpected opportunity for Dufresne to prove himself innocent - thereby shattering once and for all any trust Dufresne has placed in the fairness of the system. Never fear, though - this is, after all, a Stephen King story and the inevitable twist is well worth the wait. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is populated by a gallery of should-be stereotypes: Gunton\\'s vile warden, Clancy Brown\\'s sadistic head guard, James Whitmore\\'s white-haired lifer, Gil Bellows\\' budding career criminal and William Sadler\\'s standardissue sidekick.\\nYet they\\'re performed with such conviction, you never tire of watching them. But it\\'s Robbins and Freeman who carry the film, working around the most predictable moments with simple understatement. Both are wonderful, but if this were Oscar season, I\\'d be betting on Freeman for a nomination, if only for his heartfelt, final parole board speech. Like so much else about the film, it defies the odds; in 1994, you just don\\'t expect to buy into a long, leisurely story about a corrupt prison and decent prisoners. It may not make you support prison reform, but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" does give the prison drama a new lease on life.\\nTickets available for Perlman recital Tickets are still available for a recital by famed violinist Itzhak Perlman Thursday in Hershey.

The stars rating these high marks are Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, and their vehicle is a very loose adaptation of a very; atypical Stephen King novella, \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.\" Freeman plays Red, an old con doing a life stretch in Maine\\'s harrowingly brutal Shawshank State Prison. He\\'s the institution\\'s dog-robber the guy who, for a price, can get the other cons anything they need from the outside. 1 Robbins is Andy, a mild-mannered banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He catches Red\\'s admiring eye for the stoical dignity he shows during his first night in prison, in 1948.\\nAs narrated by Red, the story chronicles Andy\\'s prison life for the next 21 years, and it\\'s mostly : hard time: a succession of beat-ings, sojourns in solitary confinement and repeated homosexual rapes until he finally finds a way to use his business skills to make; himself indispensable to the crooked prison administration. \"-; - It also tells the more inspiration-al story of the growing friendship between the two lifers and of the positive, consciousness-raising effect Andy\\'s quiet persistence has on Red and other inmates. ; The movie is fueled by two winning performances from these two immensely likable actors: You\\'d . have to be hard-hearted not to respond on some level to their platonic love story, and not be moved by the film\\'s celebration of the endurance of the human spirit 1 The Shawshank Redemption Rated R V4 Opens today at Waikiki 2. \"Shawshank\" also scores points as a horror story.\\nEven with no spooks, it\\'s as scary as any King adaptation with an absolutely got hie setting and a chilling performance from Bob Gunton as the monstrous and hypocritical prison warden. And yet the movie also reflects the inexperience of its first-time writer-director, Frank Darabont It constantly, blatantly robs other, better prison movies \"Birdman \\' of Alcatraz\" and \"Cool Hand Luke\" as it works toward a sell-out, \"Rocky\"-like, happy ending. ; Darabont\\'s script is also drastically over-narrated, filled with story holes and improbabilities too numerous to mention, and utterly predictable: It telegraphs its plot movements every step of the way. \\' The movie is also just too brutal for its own good. Sure, this prison is tough, but depicting it as Auschwitz with ail-powerful guards casually murdering inmates, and no one on the staff showing a, spark of humanity in more than two decades is heavy-handed and exploitative.\\nBy dehumanizing everyone connected to this institution, the movie dehumanizes itself. When it is not overly brutal, it is maudlin. Freeman\\'s narration becomes a string of cliches and psycho-babble (\"Every man has his breaking point\") that seem to come from a clinical psychologist instead of a hardened old con. In another scene, James Whit-more in an otherwise good performance as a convict imprisoned so long he doesn\\'t want to be released takes his own life in a drawn-out, self-pitying sequence. And the film\\'s big emotional moment Andy defiantly playing a Mozart opera over the prison: intercom system, lifting the spirits of the cons with its exquisite beauty is a direct steal from \"Philadelphia.\".\\nUnited States\\nHawaii\\nHonolulu\\nHonolulu Star-Bulletin\\n1994\\nOct\\n07\\nPage 23\\nThe Shawshank Redemption\\nSubscribe\\nGift Subscriptions\\nHelp\\nSite Map\\nAbout\\nFish Wrap—Official Blog\\nAffiliates\\nContent Providers\\nUnited States (English)\\nVisit our other sites\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nInstagram\\n© 2024 Newspapers.com™ by Ancestry®.

But, as its own poster reveals, this film is poised to sell hope right back to us. 4 Shawshank itself, site of the picture, is the prison near King\\'s fabled Castle Rock, Maine and it\\'s a place of gray and shadowy walls, gamey, terse language and cell doors that keep slamming shut with ear-crunching iron clangs. It\\'s a prison movie, of course, almost an archetypal one.\\nAdapting King\\'s novella \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,\" with Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman as his main cons, director-writer Frank Darabont gives us all the old symbolic settings: the high walls and bare yard, the spartan warden\\'s office, the tiers and rows of bleak and clamorous cells. We get the classic characters, too: the defiant wise-cracking cons, the casually brutal guards (or \"screws\"), the outwardly pious, inwardly corrupt warden. There are menacing meals, passed notes, gang fights and, imbuing every moment, the tough yet inwardly sentimental male bonding we remember from dozens of other prison movies back to \"The Big House\" and \"Each Dawn I Die,\" \"Brute Force,\" \"Birdman of Al-catraz,\" \"Cool Hand Luke,\" \"Papillon\" and beyond. But archetypes aren\\'t necessarily predictable. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" may be .working with stuff we\\'ve seen before, but It\\'s\\'surprisingly strong and engrossing.\\nEven 7r lis Michael Wilmington Tribune movie critic \"The Shawshank Redemption\" Directed and written by Frank Darabont, based on Stephen King\\'s novella; photographed by Roger Deaklns; edited by Richard Francis-Bruce; production designed by Terence Marsh; music by Thomas Newman; produced by MU Marvin.

Just as we recognize the cliches, Darabont (and King) tip us a wink, dropping in enough realistic detail and offbeat nuance to fake the illusion of reality, make us uneasy and uncertain about where the movie is really heading. It\\'s the right strategy. Even if films like this wind up with conventional finales and \"The Shawshank Redemption\" does we appreciate the effort, the cleverness of the construction.\\nWe may also appreciate the archetypal prison picture theme: a spiritual\\' and physical\" struggle against tyrahhy and\\' in- justice. The tone is set by Morgan Freeman\\'s narration. So perfectly does his wry, salty voice weave just the right funny, world-wise and piteous frame of reference that audience members who haven\\'t read the story may be unsettled to learn King wrote most of these same speeches and narration not for an African-American but a Maine Irish redhead. (When Robbins\\' Andy asks why he\\'s named Red, and Freeman grins faintly and replies, \"I\\'m Irish,\" it\\'s a joke on the original story as much as on Andy.) Freeman, like many of the best American screen actors, has deceptively natural, consummate craft; his narration anchors the movie. As Red recollects for us, confiding his prison lore, he\\'s our all-knowing guide into a modern helL Hell is what Andy Dufresne experiences.\\nRobbins\\' brainy close-to-the vest performance makes wonderful use of some of the canny, tamped-down, wary body style he showed as killer studio exec Griffin Mill in \"The Player.\" Like Griffin, Andy a white collar criminal who supposedly killed his adulterous wife and her lover in a drunken rage is controlled, seemingly icy.

Darabont has Red explain the Sisters aren\\'t really gay because they aren\\'t \"human.\") Andy\\'s tormentors are beaten back only when he opts into the system and sells his services as financial adviser to Shawshank\\'s \"hardest screw,\" Capt.\\nByron Hadley (Clancy Brown, as a terrific bully), and eventually to the other guards and the soft-spoken Warden Norton (Bob Gunton, as an ace hypocrite). The ironies accumulate. Honest on the outside, Andy ends up masterminding the Bible-quoting Norton\\'s crooked financial schemes. Guardian of the law Capt Hadley whacks whom he pleases.

By KENNETH TURAN TIMES FILM CRITIC Awash in a bad news culture where horrors compete for media attention, America\\'s appetite for feelgood movies is all but insatiable. How else to explain \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" a film that hides a warm and cuddly fantasy about prison life behind sleek brutality, so much the better to convince us that even inside those walls life can be grand? Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman as two lifers who demonstrate the great things prison can do for you, \"Shawshank\\'s\" sentimentality is of a New Hollywood variety. Its message of hope and friendship comes premixed with a sizable dollop of unappetizing violence, intended to convince audiences that what they\\'re watching isn\\'t a big glob of cotton candy after all. Adapted from a Stephen King novella, \"Shawshank\" also labors under its literary origins, with many of its situations feeling like thin doodles blown up to big-screen size.\\nAnd its entire last section has the kind of serious plausibility problems that are only apparent when the written word takes physical form. The film gets its name from a fictional prison that is supposedly Maine\\'s toughest. It is to Shawshank sometime in 1947 that bank vice president Andy Dufresne (Robbins) is sent to serve a double life sentence for the murders of his wife and her boyfriend. In a brief prologue, we\\'ve seen Andy looking potentially murderous with a bottle and a gun in his hand, but he claims to be guilty only of confusion, not homicide. This strategy convinces no one, and Andy, a loner who strikes the judge as icy and remorseless, is convicted without a second thought.\\nPlease see PRISON, B9.\\nUnited States\\nCalifornia\\nLos Angeles\\nThe Los Angeles Times\\n1994\\nSep\\n23\\nPage 20\\nShawshank Redemption (1/2)\\nSubscribe\\nGift Subscriptions\\nHelp\\nSite Map\\nAbout\\nFish Wrap—Official Blog\\nAffiliates\\nContent Providers\\nUnited States (English)\\nVisit our other sites\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nInstagram\\n© 2024 Newspapers.com™ by Ancestry®.

But in bringing this Stephen King short story to the screen (it\\'s from Different Seasons, the anthology that also yielded Rob Reiner\\'s excellent Stand By Me), Darabont has not found Morgan Freeman (left) and Tim Robbins forge a bond as inmates in \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" a way to resolve the problems and improbabilities that tower higher than the walls of the maximum security prison where the narrative unfolds. And there is also the nagging question of the period in which Darabont has chosen to air his theme of justice, the law and incarceration as a spiritual metaphor as well as physical fact. The action begins with the double life sentence that rising young banker Andy Dufresne (Robbins) receives when he is found guilty of the murder of his wife and her lover. He goes to Shawshank Prison in the late \\'40s, and the film pivots on the intricate friendship that binds him to Ellis Redding (Freeman) over the next two decades.\\nDrugs, AIDS, overcrowding and rampant brutality have made many of our penitentiaries very different and much more dangerous places than the admittedly hard place where Dufresne does his time. With the issue of crime and punishment at the heart of an emotional and divisive national debate, Darabont\\'s preference for discussing the \\'40s and. \\'50s for a \\'90s audience is peculiar, not to mention a missed opportunity. Dufresne is a cold and remote figure whose emotions are imprisoned long before he ever sets foot in Shawshank. In a movie such as Escape From Alcatraz, this irony would simply be implied.\\nHere it is the sustaining metaphor of the film, and the plot is bent to bring out the idea of a man finding a degree of liberation in jail that eluded him in the free world. The instrument of change is Redding\\'s encouragement and Dufresne\\'s See SHAWSHANK on Page 6.\\nUnited States\\nPennsylvania\\nPhiladelphia\\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer\\n1994\\nSep\\n23\\nPage 145\\nThe Shawshank Redemption (1/2)\\nSubscribe\\nGift Subscriptions\\nHelp\\nSite Map\\nAbout\\nFish Wrap—Official Blog\\nAffiliates\\nContent Providers\\nUnited States (English)\\nVisit our other sites\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nInstagram\\n© 2024 Newspapers.com™ by Ancestry®.

This movie, based on a 1982 novella by Stephen King, does all of that. It\\'s a blissfully old-fashioned melodrama spanning three decades, a classic tall tale that experiences some particularly incredible growth spurts toward the end but manages to endure them without alienating the viewer. The opening conceit is tried, true and, admittedly, somewhat trite. In 1946, a man (Tim Robbins) is locked away for the rest of his living days after being wrongly convicted of murder.\\nOr at least we assume he\\'s been wrongly convicted the movie leaves some room for doubt. Prison life proves not only alien to this once-respected banker but also horrific. The movie trots out every cliche in the book: sadistic guards, The Shawshank Redemption Rated R; considerable violence, foul language. 4: Outstanding 3: Worthy effort 2: So-so 1: A bomb 3 worm-infested food, gang rape. It\\'s at its least inventive and most manipulative during this stretch.\\nBut then it wisely moves on to explore the ways in which Robbins learns to adapt to his incarceration and even to carve out an existence behind bars that affords him some dignity and control. He befriends a fellow convict (Mor gan Freeman) who runs the black market inside the prison, procuring and distributing everything from cigarettes to girlie posters for inflated prices. At the same time, Robbins curries favor with prison personnel by sharing his financial knowledge with them. The warden eventually sets Robbins up at a desk with a calculator and gives him the prison books. In doing so, he inadvertently gives Robbins access to secrets that represent power and a possible way out.\\nThe movie might collapse under the weight of too many coincidences and fortuitous developments were it not for director Frank Darabont\\'s impressive technique and considerable style, which lend the narrative a gravity and authority it otherwise wouldn\\'t merit. His camera work is elegant at one point, he takes the viewer on a sad, slow flight over the prison\\'s ramparts and barbed wire and he weds it to understated, rueful music, manufacturing a potent mood of despair. He and cinematographer Roger Deakins create images that aren\\'t just striking but also substantive. At one point, when Robbins speechifies about hope while Freeman counters that there\\'s little reason for it, the screen is perfectly split between sunlight and shadow, with Robbins moving into the brighter half. It\\'s a lovely touch.\\nDarabont keeps the viewer on edge by establishing early on that a given sequence may not head in a predictable direction. The movie\\'s opening scene, for example, finds Robbins in a car with a bottle with liquor and a gun, but what looks like an evolving suicide attempt is actually a man trying to summon the courage to storm in on his cheating wife and her lover. King\\'s novella, titled \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemn- tion,\" happens to be the second from rus door Diiierent beasons to be translated into a movie. The first was \"The Body,\" which became the noteworthy \"Stand by Me.\" Together, they make a case for filmmakers looking to King s lesser-known works for inspiration. They also make a case that King\\'s a better writer when the genre isn\\'t horror.\\nSome of the gorgeous dialogue and voice-over narration in \"The Shawshank Redemp tion\" are lifted precisely from his prose. Freeman\\'s delivery of that narration gives it special poignance; there may not be another actor working today with as soulful a voice. The movie, which turns out to be about the indefatigability of the human spirit, avoids becoming sappy largely because he\\'s the one articulating that theme. THE? mm.

It\\'s certainly why the film feels so fresh: It\\'s in no rush to get to the big sequences; it allows relationships to develop naturally; it\\'s got no mechanism driving it forward, no race against time, nothing cheap and melodramatic.\\nSo, it moves slowly? Deal with that. You\\'ll thank me, I guarantee you. Derived from one of Stephen King\\'s rare -horror novels, it deals with a horror of a different kind: the horror of hopelessness and its dangerous cure, the elixir of possibility.

He\\'s dumped in the yard of Shawshank Prison, a 19th-century pen that looks an essay on the meaning of hell as written in brick, mortar and the spirit of gleeful vengeance. Its architecture wisely counsels: Abandon hope, ye who enter.\\nHe\\'s there, on a darkling plain, where ignorant morons clash by night, and also by dawn, by noon and by mid-afternoon. Andy, with his fair features and softness, is soon sexually assaulted by the Sisters, the prison\\'s inevitable bully-boy homosexual clique. They make his life quite unpleasant for a number of years. But Andy has talents that resurrect him from this ignominy. Something of a financial genius, he\\'s soon doing the guards* income taxes and concocting dodges for the warden to launder illegal profits, badgering the state legislature for funds to expand the library, becoming mentor to a generation of otherwise helplessly illiterate violent felons and turning into ...\\nMother Teresa? Well, almost. For a long long time, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is content to chronicle life behind the walls of Shawshank. It moseys along like a life sentence, although helped enormously by the vividness of the place itself: an old, clanky dungeon (actually in Ohio), cold, clammy, metallic, so that the bang of a cell door reverberates with doom. The movie makes you feel the despair that eats the soul, and the fear, when the last click of the guard\\'s key is heard 8 and you are alone in the night with the rats and your yearnings and despair. The most passionately felt relationship is between Andy and WINCHESTER\\'S THE BEST IN COMEDY! APPEARING THIS WEEKEND Tim Robbins (left) and Morgan Freeman play inmates serving life sentences star in \"The the narrator, Red Redding (Morgan Freeman), another lifer and perpetual parole rejectee.\\nRed is something of a literary concoction, a seemingly illiterate man who narrates events in an ironic and astute voice that sounds as if it\\'s been educated in the nuances of Virgil and Homer. All right, movie-phony: But it\\'s one of the film\\'s great advantages that so fluent is Freeman, so intense and beguiling, that he can take you over and around that objection. He takes you over another as well: that much of \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is passively narrated, rather than actively dramatized. This lazy technique is almost always the death of any film or novel. Henry James wasn\\'t wrong when he said the three rules of fiction were \"Dramatize, dramatize, dramatize.\" Darabont works by another principle: \"Synopsize, synopsize, synopsize.\" Yet, so vividly felt are the convicts besides the two leads, the others are William Sadler, grand old James Whitmore and Brian Libby as a younger inmate - that the passivity of the storytelling seems not stale but of a different technique.\\nThe plot per se clicks in very late. It has to do with Andy\\'s usurpation by Warden Norton, played with glum vitality by the prissily ominous (and superb) Bill Gunton, in an elaborate scam that makes Andy\\'s life better but seemingly bonds him forever to the warden, who cannot afford to let him go. Laboriously, Andy creates a financial fiction that enables the Shawshank Redemption.\" warden to put away hundreds of thousands of dollars. At last there comes a time when a new witness brings in information on Andy\\'s crime, something that might get Andy out of stir, but the warden cannot allow such a thing and acts with ugly resolve to prevent it. Andy is seemingly victimized once again: the perfect schlemiel, money-smart but reality-dumb, outfoxed by the warden\\'s more feral cunning, once again broken and punished.\\nOf course, the secret pleasure of the film is that the Andy we\\'ve seen all the long hours (standing for all the long years) isn\\'t the real Andy at all. He\\'s much smarter and tougher than anybody ever imagined. Passivity again: The whole chimax is reiterated in flashback. We don\\'t see it happening, but experience it as Red re-creates it, although he cannot, by the laws of logic, know it yet. Yet so steady is the iron grip of the piece that such limp storytelling seems completely acceptable.\\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is ultimately about the blossoming of the spirit in the muddiest of grounds.

By Michael MacCambridge American-Statesman Staff By now, it's become a cinematic cliche that prisons in prison movies have their own internal logic. The hermetically sealed society has a different code of ethics, and we judge the characters who inhabit prison movies through a unique ethical prism. It's both the fault and the virtue of The Shawshank Redemption that it uses the despair of prison life as a metaphor for life on the outside, the struggle to find the best within ourselves.\\nDirector-screenwriter Frank Darabont's desire to make big statements makes for a movie that resonates beyond prison walls even as it lacks a compelling authenticity inside those walls. Set in Maine and based on a novella by Stephen King (!), Shawshank begins as a gritty tale of injustice and despair. In 1947, the jealous banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, a crime he insists he didn't commit. But protests of innocence are nothing new at the Shawshank prison, where virtually all the inmates claim they got screwed by their lawyer, nailed on a technicality or set up by the state. It's a nightmare environment, run by the stereotypically humorless prison warden (Bob Gunton) and the equally stereotypical sadistic chief prison guard (Clancy Brown).\\nAndy's induction is rough, with brutal beatings and serial rape part and parcel of his hellish life. Andy eventually falls in with a wizened veteran inmate, the resourceful, philosophical Red (Morgan Freeman), a man who maintains his dignity despite his station in life. Red is able to smuggle almost anything into the prison, from cigarettes, to drugs to posters of Film review The Shawshank Redemption Stars: Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins Director: Frank Darabont MPAA rating: R ? Theaters: Critic's rating: Rita Hayworth (which Andy uses to liven fp his cell). They develop a mutual respect and eventually a friendship, but they thrive on differing philosophies. For the longtime inmate Red, too often disillusioned by parole boards and inmates he thought were friends, hope is a dangerous thing, a recipe for misery.\\nFor Andy, still missing his life outside of the Shawshank walls, hope is a prerequisite for survival. Through two decades inside Shawshank, the two men stand by one another. Andy is an inmate entrepreneur, getting in good with the humorless authorities by handling the prison guards' tax returns and helping the warden funnel kickback money to a hidden account. 4 ., ,.S .V Morgan Freeman anchors the film with his authoritative portrayal of veteran inmate The film has enough mystery, through the fate of Andy's schemes and Red's bid for the redemption of the title, to hold the audience's attention, despite its occasional departure into melodramatics (a subplot with an aging inmate, played by James Whitmore, is somewhat undermined by its predictability). In a major studio film, when two characters are arguing about whether it's OK to have hope in life, you pretty much know where the story's heading.\\nDarabont's screenplay is too expertly massaged for its own good, but the performances, particularly Freeman's authoritative portrayal, redeem much of the formula. Freeman anchors the film with his understated observations his is the lifeless phys-icality of someone whose movement has been proscribed for much too long and his smoldering pride. Robbins is plausible but unin-volving; his character always seems to exist more in theory than jn practice (he has become a more mannered actor, but not necessarily a better one, since his breakthrough role in Bull Durham). Then there's Roger Deakins' rich, stately cinematography, with enough evocative use of muted color and shadow to make a generation of directors of blue jeans commercials weep bitter tears. The film's look lends an air of credibility that the picture sorely needs.\\nBut the hyperemotional ending (which left the two women next to me crying like they'd just watched Old Yeller get drawn and quartered) has a too-neat fit that doesn't much reflect life as we know it, much less prison life from what we've learned about it. The Shawshank Redemption winds up being the sort of tear-jerker that leaves you both moved and suspicious, a victim of the moviemaker's art too artfully executed..\\nUnited States\\nTexas\\nAustin\\nAustin American-Statesman\\n1994\\nSep\\n23\\nPage 52\\nShawshank Redemption\\nSubscribe\\nGift Subscriptions\\nHelp\\nSite Map\\nAbout\\nFish Wrap—Official Blog\\nAffiliates\\nContent Providers\\nUnited States (English)\\nVisit our other sites\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nInstagram\\n© 2024 Newspapers.com™ by Ancestry®.

Ratings are on a four-star scale.)\\nSophia Loren and Gregory Peck in Arabesque (Photo: Kino)\\nARABESQUE (1966). As the previous year’s Best Actress Oscar winner for Two Women, it was Sophia Loren who announced the Best Actor nominees for the 1962 crop and subsequently handed Gregory Peck the statue for his work in To Kill a Mockingbird. As they left the stage, she asked, “Now when are we going to do a movie together?” They didn’t have to wait long, as director Stanley Donen brought them together a few years later for this adaptation of Gordon Cotler’s novel The Cypher. Donen had such success with 1963’s Charade, a lightweight spy flick starring Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, that he decided to make another picture in that vein. Peck plays David Pollock, an American hieroglyphics professor in London. He’s roped into a case of international intrigue when he’s forced by ruthless businessman Nejim Beshraavi (Alan Badel) to decipher a secret message. Understandably, Pollock prefers to spend his time flirting with Beshraavi’s beautiful mistress Yasmin (Loren, decked out in Christian Dior), but when matters become more heated and other interested parties appear on the scene, he must decide if she’s actually friend or foe. The plot is needlessly convoluted and the comedy occasionally veers toward unsightly silliness (the ‘60s-psychedlic scene in which Pollock sings and dances in the street after being shot full of truth serum is a cringer). But the stars enjoy tremendous chemistry, the London location shooting is lovely, the action sequences deliver the goods, and Henry Mancini’s Grammy-nominated score is flat-out terrific and arguably one of his best. Arabesque was Peck’s final box office hit for an entire decade, as he would star in seven consecutive flops (including The Stalking Moon, The Chairman, and Shoot Out, reviewed here, here, and here) before headlining the 1976 blockbuster The Omen (reviewed here).\\nBlu-ray extras include film historian audio commentary; an archival piece showing Mancini at work; and the theatrical trailer.\\nMovie: ★★★\\nIdris Elba in Beasts of No Nation (Photo: Criterion)\\nBEASTS OF NO NATION (2015). Cary Joji Fukunaga, the Emmy Award-winning director of the excellent first season of HBO’s True Detective (and the helmer of the upcoming 007 film No Time to Die), serves as director, writer, producer, and cinematographer on this sobering adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s novel. Set in a West African nation, this looks at one of the many ways in which innocent children are caught in the web of war — in this case, it’s those unfortunate boys who are captured and trained to become child soldiers. Abraham Attah is Agu, a young lad happily living with his parents and siblings until the war reaches their village. The family is split up, some members are executed by the government troops, and Agu is forced to flee into the jungle. He’s eventually captured by the rebels, whose forceful leader, the Commandant (Idris Elba), determines that the boy should be trained to become a stone-cold killer. Initially, the Commandant appears to be a formidable military man in the manner of Patton, but as the story progresses, he’s revealed to be lecherous (he periodically rapes Agu and the other boy soldiers), spiteful, and self-absorbed. Beasts of No Nation pulls few punches, even if it never quite rises (artistically or emotionally) to the level of The Killing Fields or Hotel Rwanda. Elba’s excellent turn earned him SAG and Spirit Award victories and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations; his no-show among the Oscar nominees largely spearheaded that year’s #OscarsSoWhite campaign (the second such protest in as many years).\\nBlu-ray extras consist of audio commentary by Fukunaga and first assistant director Jon Mallard; a new making-of featurette; a new conversation between Fukunaga and cultural commentator Franklin Leonard; a new interview with costume designer Jenny Eagan; and the theatrical trailer.\\nMovie: ★★★\\nScarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh in Black Widow (Photo: Marvel)\\nBLACK WIDOW (2021). If there was a clear low point in 2019’s Avengers: Endgame, it was the death of Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow. As superbly played by Scarlett Johansson, Natasha was the most complex and, in many ways, most mature of all MCU characters. Set in earlier times, Black Widow appears on the scene after its protagonist has already been killed off, giving the film an air of too little, too late; basically, it’s Marvel’s middle finger directed at all of the characters’ fans. Nevertheless, as its own entity, as a work removed from the politics of the studio and the overreach of the Avengers’ MCU entries, Black Widow is a satisfying movie, with director Cate Shortland and the trio of writers wisely allowing the superhero shenanigans to often take a back seat to the espionage components. In some ways, this feels like a good version of the 2018 Jennifer Lawrence vehicle Red Sparrow (reviewed here), as it’s far more intriguing and far less rapey. The storyline finds Natasha helping her estranged sister Yelena (Florence Pugh) take down a ruthless Russian (Ray Winstone), a mission that reunites the pair with the spies (Rachel Weisz and David Harbour) who once served as their ersatz parents. The movie contains the sort of outlandish — and, yes, exciting — action sequences found in all MCU product, but the focus isn’t fisticuffs as much as it’s family. The strained relationship between the pseudo-siblings provides the film with many of its best moments, due in no small part to the work by Johansson and Pugh. Ultimately, Black Widow provides for a decent sendoff, but given Marvel’s stellar reputation for mapping out every nanosecond of every MCU effort, there’s nevertheless the unshakable feeling that someone botched the timing on this one.\\nBlu-ray extras include an introduction by Shortland; deleted scenes; and a gag reel.\\nMovie: ★★★\\nJohn Denver and George Burns in Oh, God! (Photo: Shout! Factory)\\nTHE OH, GOD! COLLECTION (1977-1984). It’s no surprise that Mel Brooks was reportedly the first choice to play the role of God in Oh, God! (1977), considering that he and director Carl Reiner often worked together and were great friends in real life. That didn’t come to pass, but even as a gargantuan Brooks fan, I can’t imagine anyone playing the part of The Almighty better than George Burns. One of the 10 highest grossing films of its year, this finds singer-songwriter John Denver making his film debut as Jerry Landers, a sweet-natured supermarket manager who’s personally chosen by God to let everyone know that He is still around and still in business. Jerry’s wife (Teri Garr, basically playing the same disbelieving character she did in Close Encounters of the Third Kind later that year) thinks he might be going crazy, and she’s not the only one — also expressing doubt are a number of religious figures, including a slimy evangelist (Paul Sorvino) and a tight-lipped theologian (a few seconds of fourth-billed Donald Pleasence, obviously the victim of some massive pre-release cuts). The film’s success is due to its sincerity, eschewing the sort of tasteless and cynical jokes that such a project would naturally attract. It’s sweet without being cloying, and Burns’ Lord gets off some thoughtful passages as well as some amusing quips (“Cows were an afterthought. Just to give new mothers a little rest, you know.”). Working from Avery Corman’s novel, Larry Gelbart earned a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar nomination for his efforts.\\nLouanne and George Burns in Oh, God! Book II (Photo: Shout! Factory)\\nOh, God! Book II (1980) is the laziest kind of sequel, with those involved with this production (tellingly, not Reiner, Gelbart or the original’s producer, Jerry Weintraub) choosing just to make a faded fax of the first film. It’s the same plot, except instead of a young man as God’s emissary and a climax set in a courtroom (where His authenticity is challenged), this settles on a little girl as God’s chosen one and a similar climax where He appears before a panel of psychiatrists. It’s all rather drab, although Louanne is likable as the little girl and God again gets off some notable zingers.\\nGeorge Burns and George Burns in Oh, God! You Devil (Photo: Shout! Factory)\\nOh, God! You Devil (1984) takes a cute idea — Burns plays both God and Satan — and then surrounds it with a bad movie. Ted Wass, one of the unfortunate Peter Sellers replacements in The Pink Panther series (see review here), plays Bobby Shelton, a struggling singer-songwriter who unwittingly sells his soul to the devil in exchange for fame and fortune. Oddly, the film doesn’t give him his own career but turns him into another person, an already established rock star — it’s a narrative decision that not only makes little sense but also dilutes any forthcoming catharsis. At any rate, it’s up to God to save this sinner from his own mistakes. It’s fun to watch Burns vs. Burns in the trick-photography sequences, but that’s the only entertainment to be had in this dreary and dim-witted sequel.\\nBlu-ray extras include film critic audio commentary on all three titles; audio commentary on Oh, God! by Reiner, Gelbart, Garr, and Weintraub; and theatrical trailers. The best bonuses are an appearance by Burns as the devil on a 1956 episode of The Jack Benny Program, and portions of two 1977 episodes of The Johnny Carson Show, with Denver guest-hosting and chatting with guests Reiner, Burns, and Garr (Valerie Harper and Kenny Rogers can also be spotted).\\nOh, God!: ★★★\\nOh, God! Book II: ★★\\nOh, God! You Devil: ★½\\nTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in The Shawshank Redemption (Photo: Warner)\\nTHE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (1994). The most overrated movie of all time? Going by box office, that would be Avatar. Going by Oscar nominations, that would be Joker. And going by IMDb, that would be writer-director Frank Darabont’s adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Absurdly ranked as the best movie of all time by the site’s users, this dude-bro fave is neither the best King screen adaptation (there’s Carrie, for one) nor the best movie of its year (at least 20 were superior, including Pulp Fiction, Quiz Show, Hoop Dreams, and Little Women). Nevertheless, there’s much to enjoy in this period prison flick, starting with a fine performance by Tim Robbins and a superb one by Morgan Freeman. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a banker accused of murdering his wife and her lover (he maintains his innocence) and sent to Maine’s Shawshank State Prison. There, his beatific nature wins over practically everyone (the wag who once called this Forrest Gump Goes to Prison was not wrong; neither, incidentally, was the one who tagged it “Beaches for men”), particularly a fellow inmate known as Red (Freeman). The first half is the stronger portion, as the second hour leans too heavily on convenient developments, increasingly one-dimensional villains, and a string of overly schematic final acts. The entire film is basically a fantasyland version of prison: For starters, aside from the handful of guys (“the Sisters”) who gang-rape Andy, the hundreds of other murderers, rapists, and thieves prove to be about as threatening as the Bowery Boys. Still, many individual scenes sparkle, and tech contributions (Roger Deakins’ camerawork, Thomas Newman’s music) are first-rate. This earned seven Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Actor (Freeman), Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, and Original Score.\\nBlu-ray extras in the 4K edition include audio commentary by Darabont; a retrospective piece; and storyboards.\\nMovie: ★★★\\nBruce Campbell and Deborah Foreman in Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat (Photo: Lionsgate & Vestron Video)\\nSUNDOWN: THE VAMPIRE IN RETREAT (1989). The 1980s proved to be the stomping ground of many an unusual and entertaining horror film, but you wouldn’t always know it from just scanning the marquees. While the multiplexes were clogged with Halloween, Friday the 13th, and A Nightmare on Elm Street sequels, more interesting titles didn’t see the light of day until they appeared on VHS and managed to build up cult followings — these unique efforts include 1986’s Night of the Creeps, 1988’s Killer Klowns from Outer Space (reviewed here), and this vampire flick set (or at least filmed) in Utah. David Carradine stars as Count Mardulak, a vampire who had herded his fellow bloodsuckers to the dusty town of Purgatory in an effort to break their nasty necking habit. Because these vampires can walk around in daylight — albeit while always wearing sunglasses and the strongest sunblock available — Mardulak figures they can become even more human-like by only drinking synthetic blood produced at a local factory. When the facility breaks down, the human designer (Jim Metzler), with wife (Morgan Brittany) and daughters in tow, arrives to help out, unaware that his family will be caught in a war between Mardulak and a pair of vampires (John Ireland and Maxwell Caulfield) seeking to return to the violent old ways. Meanwhile, Robert Van Helsing (Bruce Campbell), the bumbling descendant of the famed vampire slayer, shows up with a plan to kill Mardulak, only to fall for a shapely young vampire (Deborah Foreman) instead. Writer-director Anthony Hickox and co-scripter John Burgess have crafted a lively and limber movie, foregoing any semblance of mean-spiritedness and instead relying on quirky characters and oddball humor.\\nBlu-ray extras include audio commentary by Hickox and director of photography Levie Isaacks; interviews with Hickox, Carradine, and Campbell; and the theatrical trailer.\\nMovie: ★★★\\nJames Spader and Keanu Reeves in The Watcher (Photo: Mill Creek)\\nTHE WATCHER (2000) / THE SKELETON KEY (2005). Mill Creek Entertainment has released a double feature Blu-ray containing two thrillers from the aughts.\\nThe Watcher stars James Spader as Jack Campbell, an FBI agent who’s haunted by the fact that he’s never been able to apprehend David Allen Griffin (Keanu Reeves), a psychopath who targets single women, studies their routines for weeks, and then strangles them with wire. Moving from Los Angeles to Chicago, Campbell figures he’ll never have to deal with his deranged nemesis again, but he’s wrong. Eager to keep their cat-and-mouse game going, Griffin follows Campbell to the Windy City and starts up again with the murders. Directed by Joe Charbanic (who has yet to helm another feature, making this a one-and-done), The Watcher is a poor thriller further tarnished by a miscast Reeves. Watching the actor portray a brilliant serial killer is akin to watching a month-old kitten try to navigate its way across a junkyard guarded by a half-dozen pit bulls — it ain’t a pretty sight. The visual effects in the climactic scene are spectacularly unconvincing, looking like the flames from a roaring fire were merely superimposed over the actor appearing in the scene.\\nKate Hudson in The Skeleton Key (Photo: Mill Creek)\\nThe Skeleton Key finds Kate Hudson playing Caroline Ellis, a caretaker who’s hired to look after a stroke victim (John Hurt) residing in a creaky mansion in the middle of the Louisiana swamps. The patient’s wife (Gena Rowlands) views Caroline with suspicion, though she quickly earns the trust of the elderly couple’s lawyer (Peter Sarsgaard); at any rate, it’s not long before Caroline has to keep her guard up, as mysterious events suggest that a paranormal presence might be functioning within the house. The supernatural element extends beyond what’s taking place on the screen, as it appears that Rowlands, delivering a performance of high camp, has been possessed by What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?-era Bette Davis. While enjoyable, her overripe turn dilutes the story’s potency, while director Iain Softley has difficulty maintaining the proper degree of Gothic atmosphere that a spook story of this nature requires. Thankfully, the movie rights itself in time for a satisfying twist ending.\\nThere are no extras.\\nThe Watcher: ★½\\nThe Skeleton Key: ★★½\\n  SHARE THIS:\\nTweet\\nShare\\nWhatsApp\\nEmail\\nRELATED\\nView from the Couch: The Ghost Breakers, Roman Holiday, etc.\\nSeptember 18, 2020\\nIn \"Blu-ray / DVD\"\\nView from the Couch: Alien: Covenant, Duel in the Sun, Hopscotch, etc.\\nAugust 16, 2017\\nIn \"Blu-ray / DVD\"\\nView from the Couch: The Kiss of the Vampire, The War of the Worlds, etc.\\nJuly 17, 2020\\nIn \"Blu-ray / DVD\"\\nPOSTED ON SEPTEMBER 17, 2021 BY MATT BRUNSON POSTED IN BLU-RAY / DVD TAGGED #BLU-RAY / DVD, REVIEWS\\n2 Comments »\\nDan Stamos\\nFEBRUARY 27, 2022 AT 8:57 PM REPLY\\nMatt Brunson called the Shawshank redemption the “most overrated movie of all time”. perfect, courageous beauty 100% care about film\\nsabretruthtiger\\nJUNE 26, 2022 AT 8:54 AM REPLY\\n[Blocked by my assistant, who said his comment for The Shawshank Redemption was idiotic and offensive and typical right-wing hate-mongering.

As an aside, she also added that it’s no wonder this MRA would call The Shawshank Redemption his favorite film since it’s populated almost exclusively by men, and that he hates Mad Max: Fury Road because it has a strong female character.]\\nLeave a comment\\nNEXT POST\\nView from the Couch: Justice League, Star Trek Set, Vincent Price Films, etc.\\nPREVIOUS POST\\nEarnest Film Never Finds The Way\\nFollow Film Frenzy via Email\\nEnter your email address to follow this site and receive notifications of new posts by email.\\nFollow\\nJoin 5,744 other subscribers\\nSupport Film Frenzy\\nLove movies?

Castle Rock IN FOR LIFE: Morgan Freeman teaches fellow inmate Tim Robbins how to survive in Shawshank Deliver us from happy endings I Fabulous cinematography aside, The Shawshank Redemption tries too hard to put a clean finish on a gritty tale of prison life. By STEVE PERSALL Times Film Critic rison life is like a box of chocolates; sweeter P tion than is \"Gumpian\" one to be might jail believed. flick expect, The The if only Frank Shawshank difference Darabont\\'s Redemp- is that you can easily guess what you\\'re going to get. Darabont\\'s first outing as a director is visually impressive yet somewhat emotionally stale, a result of his oversimplification of Stephen King\\'s parable of hopeful survival, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.\\nRoger Deakins\\' camera captures the claustrophobic, forboding nature of life behind bars, and Darabont coaxes performances of conviction from his lead actors, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman as a pair of lifers. But Darabont\\'s adaptation of King\\'s story depicts its dramatic conflicts in elementary black-and-white rather than the provocative prison grays of the novella. Robbins\\' bleary eyed innocence is well-utilized as Andy Dufresne, a banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank Prison in 1947. He isn\\'t prepared for this hellish existence; a daily routine of beatings and rapes soon takes shape. Andy still glides through each day \"like he was wearing an invisible coat that shielded him from this place,\" according to Red Redding (Freeman), in one of his continuous, overly poetic narrations.\\nRed is the prison fixer, \"a regular Sears and Roebuck\" 3065 Prison. who\\'ll smuggle any contraband into Shawshank for the right price. Freeman invests the part with more humanity and dignity than such a sidekick role typically demands - he\\'s an actor who can convey pages of character exposition in a single pregnant pause. Robbins and Freeman are a wonderful polar pairing; young and old, white and black, minimalist and expressionist actors. Watching Andy and Red\\'s wary friendship blossom through these performers is the best aspect of Darabont\\'s film.\\nHow unfortunate that Darabont the screenwriter isn\\'t as adventurous as Darabont the auteur. The Shawshank Prison of King\\'s story was frightening enough, and his characters\\' dreams and disillusionments of escaping captivity held a startling poignancy. Darabont apparently doubted that audiences could appreciate such understated, internalized drama. Or perhaps that he could film it. Instead, we get the usual prison conflict of the goodhearted inmates\\' struggle against a sadistic, hypocritical warden (Bob Gunton) and his equally inviolate guards.\\nA key point in King\\'s version was that Andy had stashed away a small 1 fortune in financial investments in case he ever escaped. Now it\\'s the warden\\'s money he siphons away -a certain crowd-pleaser after the warden has arranged the murder of a popular prisoner (another incident not in the book). There is no place for the subtlety of human potential for goodness or evil in The Shawshank Redemption. Darabont dresses up his characters in easy-to-read nobility or savagery, diluting one of King\\'s most tenderly complex works. Only a brisk subplot of an aging inmate (James Whitmore) reluctantly paroled matches the nonchalant impact of the novella.\\nThe rest of The Shawshank Redemption huffs and puffs to put approving smiles on our faces. So intent is Darabont that we leave the theater feeling uplifted that he fashions one of the longest anticlimaxes in memory, taking the story several scenes beyond King\\'s purposely vague conclusion for a feel good fade-out. This wouldn\\'t be as irritating if we hadn\\'t seen more genuine, affecting stories of incarcerated rebels before, and always with more downbeat realism. When R. P.\\nMcMurphy got lobotomized and smothered in One Flew Over the Cuckoo\\'s Nest or Cool Hand Luke caught a bullet in the head, it was because the system had no other way of handling them. They didn\\'t get what they deserved. Andy and Red do, but only because Darabont has turned them into the undeniable saints of Shawshank Prison..\\nUnited States\\nFlorida\\nSt. Petersburg\\nTampa Bay Times\\n1994\\nOct\\n07\\nPage 109\\nThe Shawshank Redemption\\nSubscribe\\nGift Subscriptions\\nHelp\\nSite Map\\nAbout\\nFish Wrap—Official Blog\\nAffiliates\\nContent Providers\\nUnited States (English)\\nVisit our other sites\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nInstagram\\n© 2024 Newspapers.com™ by Ancestry®.

But if \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" adapted from a Stephen King novella, is familiar, it earns respect by configuring these familiar elements in an engaging, shrewdly constructed way. The prison drama, written and directed by Frank Darabont in his first theatrical feature, is genuinely scary, bleakly beautiful, slyly funny and driven by strong performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman and a gifted, well-chosen supporting cast. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a bright, self-contained Maine banker convicted of killing his wife and her lover. Sent to the big house Maine\\'s Shawshank Prison in 1947, he stays behind bars until 1966, all the while quietly plotting an escape and playing his cards close to the vest.\\nBut first he has to learn the face value of the cards. This is where Red (Freeman), a convicted murderer who has already been locked up for 20 years, comes in. Red clues Andy in on the unwritten rules of prison life. Despite Red\\'s advice, Andy suffers. He is beaten and raped, thrown into solitary confinement, exiled to grinding work in the prison laundry.\\nThen, in one ineffably affecting scene, he scores a breakthrough: Hearing a particularly nasty guard whine that the IRS is poised to grab his inheritance, Andy explains how to beat Uncle Sam and keep it all. Now, Andy is a fair-haired boy. In one of the film\\'s well-realized comic moments, he does the guards\\' taxes and comes to the attention of the bible-thumbing warden (a menacing turn by Broadway veteran Bob Gunton), who enlists the ex-banker in an elaborate bookkeeping scheme and banks the laundered money. Andy, as he himself points out, had to go Tim Robbins is a mild-mannered New to prison to become a crook. One might quibble with this movie\\'s benign portrayal of nearly all the convicts they\\'re just gruff, manly jokers who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, not hardened criminals.\\nBut Darabont carefully builds the story, showing, little by little, how mild-mannered, seemingly acquiescent Andy is secretly conning the warden. Robbins plays Andy so economically, he is practically comatose. His body language is careful, controlled, but there is a wispy smile on his lips, the suggestion of a secret that Andy always seems to be - a , 27\\' 7\"3 A j r J; I ...

The movie, so surefooted in its depiction of the brutality, tedium and thwarted hopes of prison life, makes some missteps toward the end.

DUPRE STAFF WRITER ee \"The Shawshank S son: watching the Redemption\" a pleasure fine for actor of one at reahis craft. Has Morgan Freeman ever had a disingenuous moment on screen? He\\'s one of those rare actors who inhabits each character he plays with such utter comfort that we don\\'t even realize he\\'s acting. When Freeman is on screen, there is no bombast or histrionics, just the quiet authority of an insightful actor at work. Freeman\\'s talent glows all the more warmly in \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" a turgid and ordinary prison drama otherwise filled with stock characters.\\nFreeman plays \"Red\" Redding, an aging inmate who has become both cynic and shaman during a lifetime behind bars at Shawshank State Prison in Maine, a turreted stone castle of horrors complete with its own bloodless Count Dracula: a Bibletoting prison warden who uses the inmates like assets in a portfolio.

(it) could now make the top 30 on Forbes\\' 500 lists,\" according to the Columbia Journalism Re view. The Shawshank Redemption takes us inside the human conclusion of that depressing thought to see prison not as a setting for an action movie, but as a torture chamber for the soul. This grim, powerful drama will make you think twice about the lives of the people we incarcerate. While the film may have a grinding effect on your emotions, it echoes the impact of Papillon as it narrows down the possibility of hope to the smallest glimmer in the dim years of men who have thrown away their lives.\\nThe film focuses on the friendship of two inmates: Andy (Tim Robbins), a banker sentenced to life for murdering his wife and her lover, and Red (Morgan Freeman), who already has been in Maine\\'s Shawshank Prison for 20 years when Andy arrives in 1947. Over the next 20 years, the two men become good friends, as Andy learns how to survive in prison against dangerous guards and just-as-dangerous prisoners. The movie illuminates the small triumphs in Andy\\'s life, as he gains \\'favors for the men by using his skills at finance to help a crooked warden amass an illegal fortune. Like other prison movies, The Shawshank Redemption honestly confronts the grim reality of prison life: brutal beatings by sadistic guards, rape, constant demeaning of the spirit. But the movie transcends bleakness because of its insights into the perseverance of hope within the darkness of human suffering.\\nThis is not an easy film to sit through. Dut in the end, it\\'s an uplifting experience. We can always use a movie that offers us a moment of redemption. While the film may not fart, v (I Michael Welnstein Morgan Freeman (left foreground) and Tim Robbins play inmates in The Shawshank Redemption, a tale of survival. become a box-office smash, it will affect some people profoundly.\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is, based on a Stephen King story. The script is so literary and elementally moving that writerdirector Frank Darabont, making his first feature film, must have added those qualities to King\\'s story. When it comes to the plot twists at the end, you can see the King touch. Because of the film\\'s surprises, see it before someone gives away too much of the ending. Darabont has crafted an intelligent, perceptive picture.\\nBut at nearly IVi hours, it\\'s an emotional endurance match, blanketing the audience with the oppressive mood under which prisoners live until you feel the weight and drag of their empty days. Both Robbins and Freeman will be Oscar contenders for their fine performances. Robbins seems to specialize in difficult-title movies, starring earlier this year in the equally oblique The Hudsucker Proxy. The Shawshank Redemption is rated R for violence, profanity and sex.

They\\'re always about some poor guy who gets thrown in the slammer and then goes through horrible initiation rites. Inevitably he\\'s beaten, raped, picked on by the tough guys, picked on by the guards, and then he finds some kind of salvation. Along the way a few other inmates will die in tragic ways, there will be a blatant abuse of human rights, and worst of all, the corresponding feeling of outrage mixed with helplessness that makes, in general, for extremely dreary viewing. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" follows the formula right down the line.\\nAnd then it goes beyond that into a world filled with humor, hope and inspiration. By the end, this stirring film becomes an uplifting tribute to the human spirit, a \"Forrest Gump\" behind bars. Based on the Stephen King 37917 02 Michael Weinstein Morgan Freeman plays a seasoned lifer who befriends Tim Robbins in \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" short story \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\" (from the collection that includes \"Stand By Me\"), the film begins in the 1940s and covers two decades with seamless ease. Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a mild-mannered bank vice president who is wrongly convicted for the murders of his wife and her lover. Sentenced to double life terms in Maine\\'s Shawshank prison, he arrives still dazed by his fate.\\nShawshank is no country club, though it\\'s immediately apparent that prison life was somewhat different half a century ago. The other inmates aren\\'t nearly as threatening or as hardcore as they would be in a modern drama, which is an unsuspected gift for moviemaking. Though he wrote the screenplay for the upcoming \"Mary Shelley\\'s Frankenstein,\\' he\\'s mostly known for schlock like \"The Blob,\" \"The Fly II\" and \"Nightmare on Elm Street 3.\" Yet \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is perfectly conceived and executed, with its dark, muted tones reflecting the prison\\'s status as a place cut off from life. There are moments of light - a scene in which Andy inveigles beers for the boys on a hot summer day, or the sudden glow that fills the prison library when Andy\\'s campaign to find funding for it comes through. But mostly, there is spirit.\\nAndy becomes a more engrossing character as the film progresses, surprising us along with the other inmates. Time is marked by a succession of pin-up posters, from Rita Hayworth to Marilyn Monroe to Raquel Welch, but it\\'s also marked by the way Andy grows in his situation. In that he\\'s almost unique. The saga of an older inmate, played beautifully by James Whitmore, pays haunting tribute to the alternatives. From beginning to end, Robbins and Freeman command the film.\\nTheir performances are equally astonishing. But it\\'s Darabont who gets most of the credit for turning a small story into a profoundly moving epic. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is one prison movie that rewards the time you have to spend behind bars. not to say they\\'re perfect gentlemen. Indeed, as the new prisoners are herded in through the gates, bets are taken on which guy is going to crack the first night.\\nIt isn\\'t Andy. But that\\'s who Red places his money on. As played by the wonderful Morgan Freeman, Red is a seasoned lifer who serves as a lifeline for the other prisoners. Wise and wry, he\\'s the guy who can get you anything, with a thriving black market business that makes him the self-described \"Sears and Roebuck\" of Shawshank. Red senses immediately that there\\'s something different about Andy.\\nHe watches him walk through the prison yard with the sauntering steps of a man on a Sunday afternoon stroll. It\\'s not just that Andy is smart and welleducated. He\\'s in a world of his own, and Robbins keeps him that way. His gentle face and manner mask his emotions, but Red is there to decipher them for us. He becomes fascinated with Andy, and they become friends.\\nThat doesn\\'t save Andy from being repeatedly raped and beaten by a gang called The Sisters, but giving financial advice to the vicious head guard does. Soon Andy has a thriving business of his own, preparing tax returns for all the guards and then becoming a financial planner for the Bible-spouting, sadistic warden (Bob Gunton).

Based on a novella by Stephen King, \"The Shawshank Redemp-tion\" is one of those stone-walls-do-not-a-prison-make stories. It\\'s a stirring saga of hope despite horrifying ciraimstances, of an enduring friendship forged in the midst of a human purgatory, mjan purgatory. .\\nRobbins plays Andy Du-fresne, a quiet bank executive who, in the late 1940s, is shipped off to Shawshank Prison for the iriurder of his wife and her lover.

At Shawshank, Andy soon learns the facts of prison life: sexual assault by other inmates, maggot-filled meals, the casual brutality of the guards and a sanctimonious warden (Bob Gunton) who believes in \"discipline and the Bible.\" However, there\\'s also Red (Freeman), an other lifer, who\\'s known around the yard as \"the man who can get it for you\\'1 \"it\" being anything from cigarettes to reefer. But even Red is taken aback when Andy asks him to smuggle Rita Hayworth into Shawshank. Ever-resourceful, Red comes up with a poster of the glamour queen which, as the decades pass, is replaced on Andy\\'s cell wall by Marilyn Monroe and then Raquel Welch in her \"One Million Years B.C.\" phase. The movie covers two decades and takes more than two hours to do so.\\nSome scenes may seem all too familiar to genre-veterans, but writerdirector Frank Darabont has found some wonderful ways of updating cliches. Plus, there\\'s unique sweetness in Andy and Red\\'s relationship and these two seasoned pros savor every nuance. In an odd way, just as \"Natu ral Born Killers\" was a kind of 90s \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption\" takes another iconic film from the \\'60s, Paul Newman\\'s \"Cool Hand Luke\" and gives it a \\'90s spin. \"Luke\" was whimsical and stubbornly rebellious, as befit the time (\"What we have here is a failure to communicate\"). \"Shawshank\" is meticulous and grueling, with a hero who crafts his survival as carefully as a crooked Wall Street broker.\\nMaking his big-screen debut, Darabont makes the typical first-timer\\'s mistake of holding onto too much footage; the movie could lose 20 minutes. But his work scene by scene is crisp and efficient Most importantly, he knows . how to stay out of his actors\\' way. Any picture that co-stars Robbins and Freeman is halfway home already.

Shavshank Redemption a prison drama with dignity BILL BROWNSTEIN THE GAZETTE \\' The title would more befit some Ttwisted Stephen King offering \\'about a possessed Pontiac or a rabid dog terrorizing a town of American innocents. That\\'s not entirely accidental. The Shawshank Redemption is based on a novella by master-of-;thc-macabre King - and is lifted ;from the same bestseller that included The Body, which inspired \\'.\\'the movie Stand By Me. ; Clearly, this was a relatively ;kinderand gentler King, t Oh, there are plenty of vermin \"that pervade The Shawshank Re-demption - adapted for the screen and directed by Frank Darabont.\\n!But The Shawshank Redemption is mostly a movie about hope, an up-- lift ing saga about the human con-. Edition - words not often used to dc-;scribe a Stephen King oeuvre. The Shawshank Redemption is .\\'also a powerhouse drama with unforgettably moving performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. \\'. Robbins is cast as Andy Dufresne, \".a laconic, bottled-up Maine banker ; who is sentenced to life in the maxi- :mura security Shawshank State \\'Prison for murdering his wife and her golf-pro lover in 1946.\\nOne-man black market \"\\' Dufresne denies committing the :crime. Big deal, he soon learns, every inmate at the Shawshank jug \"professes innocence for their llheinous acts as well. Freeman plays one such lifer, the cool and collected Red Redding, Shawshank\\'s one-man black market who can import anything from al-.-cohol to playing cards with pictures of naked women. Because of his standing and the length of his stint, Redding is immune from reprisals from the inmates and the guards. Dufresne is not.\\nJ.-Dufresne must endure all sorts of Uinspeakable physical and sexual )buse - which is mercifully more ;3itfflied than graphically depicted \\'M the hands of some sadistic inmates. And he must endure the demonic, Bible-spouting prison war-\\'\\'4e\\'n (Bob Gunton) and his rr \\' i.a raa o j outrageously brutal head henchman (Clancy Brown). After a few years of internal hell, Dufresne gets smart. First, he forges an unlikely friendship with Redding that ends up spanning 20 years. Smarter still, though, Dufresne uses his professional civilian skills to curry favor with inmates and guards.\\nDufresne becomes Shawshank\\'s resident financial planner. He does tax returns. Me sets up trust funds. And he launders the diabolical warden\\'s ill-gotten money gains through a maze of banks. \"I had to come to prison to lcam to become a crook,\" he notes.\\nFraught with Irony Oddly, he also had to come to prison to evolve as a human. He sets up a library, introduces inmates to the classics and helps some get their high-school diplomas. The Shawshank Redemption is fraught with irony. There are moments of levity. There are moments of unbearable pain.\\nLove and hate abound equally. In short, this prison is but a microcosm of society. H umane prison dramas are nothing new at the movies: Birdman of Alcatraz, Brubaker, Cool Hand Luke et al. And like the latter, Shawshank too is not beyond melodrama and obvious metaphors about life inside the pen. But Shawshank, like precious few films in the genre, brings a dignity, strength and compassion that has become all too rare on the screen these days.\\nRobbins, Freeman and James Whitmore, as the prison\\'s elderly librarian inmate, bring a sincerity and conviction to their roles that seems almost effortless. It\\'s not. It\\'s called great acting - but of the sort that emerges only when all the other elements are in place. And that they are in The Shawshank Redemption. It\\'s just the title that trips you up.\\nGet over it! The Shawshank Redemption opens today at the Faubourg theatre.

So its no surprise that the latest Tim Robbins movie, The Shawshank Redemption, based on a King novella, sometimes strains credulity. Soft-spoken New England banker Andy Dufresne (played by Robbins) is convicted of a crime he didnt commit the murder of his wife and her lover. Not that he didnt want to kill them. Parked outside the couples tryst, he fuels himself with a flask, loads his revolver and gets out of the car to wreak a cuckolds revenge ...\\nbut he just doesnt have it in him. It looks more like a lack of gumption than a triumph of conscience especially when he offers a mealymouthed defense at the trial. So oncehes imprisoned for the double murder, the resilience, resoluteness and resourcefulness he shows behind the walls of Shawshank State Prison arise from a well of strength that he seemingly didnt have. The movie, directed by Frank Darabont, offers the notion that many inmates at a maximum-security penitentiary are just misunderstood ex-Rotarians. However, if you can get past patchy character development and lefty underpinnings about criminal justice, The Shawshank Redemption stands as an uplifting story of enduring hope forged by an indomitable spirit and the bonds of a rock-solid friendship.\\nWhen Andy and several newcomers first arrive in 1947, the veteran inmates take bets on which one will crack first. Red, the prisons fixer (Morgan Freeman) who can get just about any contraband inside, wagers on the milquetoast mo-neyman. Andy copes; Red loses. Initially aloof, Andy eventually asks Red to sneak in a rock hammer, explaining that he simply wants to indulge his interest in geology and carve a chess set. I As their friendship develops, Red teaches Andy about survival on the inside while Andy teaches Red about never giving up the idea of a good life on the outside.\\nSo when Andy asks for Rita Hayworth to be snuck in, Red comes through albeit with just a sexy poster. As 19 years pass, Rita is supplanted by Marilyn Monroe in the 50s and Raquel Welch (in her skimpiest One Million Years B.C. best) in the 60s. And as the film unfolds, a rock hammer in tandem with a good two-dimensional woman proves to be quite the combo. Andy, meanwhile, thrives in a financial-planning cottage industry that provides one of the movies surprises.\\nDarabont, who previously directed a USA Network cable movie and a PBS short film, adapted Kings story for the screen. He allows the story to drag occasionally, but he captures the oppressive atmosphere of a hard-time jail and makes a sure-handed debut as a director for the big screen. Robbins, whose stardom again is reinforced with' this performance, gives a neatly understated rendering of Andy. r Two-time Academy Award nominee James Whitmore makes a welcome return to movies after seven years, playing the prisons librarian, Brooks. Freeman, whose Red learns how to avoid Brooks fate, stands tallest among this strong ensemble.\\nActor Tim Robbins, right, and Redemption.

Poor BY TERRY LAWSON Film Critic he same book of short novellas by Stephen King that yielded one of the very best film adaptations of a King tale, Stand By Me also is the source of The Shawshank Redemption, a prison drama that is more sentimental than savage. Like Stand By Me, The Shawshank Redemption is set (mostly) in a simpler past, focuses on male friendship and is capped by what we are supposed to recognize as an ingenious twist. But even those who hang on King\\'s every cliche will admit that the plots are often more formulaic than fascinating, that his true strength is in character. Thankfully, that\\'s also the emphasis of The Shawshank Redemption, which exaggerates prison life the way Stand By Me exaggerated adolescent growing pains.\\n- Though it was filmed at Ohio\\'s Mansfield Reformatory, it\\'s true setting is the cellblock of every prison movie you\\'ve ever seen or imagined. The only thing missing is the rat chewing on the ankle, which we can assume is an over-, sight. Nevertheless, The Shawshank Redemption is affecting and entertaining, solely because first-time director Frank Darabont, who also adapted the script from King\\'s novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption lets his actors do the talking, and they play this piece at precisely the right pitch: somewhere between \"Oh that\\'s awful,\\'\\' and \"Isn\\'t that wonderful.\" It starts, naturally, on the low end of the scale, in 1939 New England, when up-and-coming bank manager Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of the double murder of his wife and the golf pro with whom she was sleeping. Andy proclaims his innocence, but with such lack of emotion that he is labelled a remorseless cold fish. Slapped with two life sentences, he is shipped off to Maine\\'s Shawshank prison, a place of casual brutality ruled by a Bible-thumping warden (Bob 8 t m Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are prison .\\nOunton) whose rules and whims are enforced by a sadistic guard (Clancy Brown). When Andy arrives, longtime Shawshank resident Red Red- . ding (Morgan Freeman) bets he will be the first of the newcomers to crack; when he doesn\\'t, Red is as impressed as he is surprised. Red is equally impressed at the way Andy handles the \"sisters\" who serve him regular assaults; he fights back, but never rats. So when Andy approaches Red (who can seemingly fill every prisoner\\'s want list with ease and at slightly above retail) with a request for a small geologist\\'s hammer (he\\'s a rock hound, he explains).\\nRed is willing to comply, despite the risk. This, he realizes could be a guy worth spending some time with, and time is the only thing everybody in Shawshank has in abundance. Over the years, as parole hearings come and go, Andy is able to use his quiet logic and quick mind to ingratiate himself not only with the other prisoners, but also with the guards, by helping them avoid taxes. His fame spreads until he is handling the business affairs of the warden, who turns out to have lots of affairs to attend to. That some of these are not quite kosher provides what screenwriters and novelists refer to as \"the MacGuffin,\" the thing that leads us through the story.\\nThe only item of interest, though, is the sweet, understated relationship between Andy and Red, neither of whom, of course, has any real business in a prisoa (Nor, it seems, do any of their pals, a chipper chain gang modeled on The Bowery Boys, lovable lugs with big hearts and punched-in faces.) The idea is that the friendship is symbiotic, with each man pro NORM STULZ Ijl BETH DONAHUE -1 wish I could tat m story tm , tyTX\\'ttTZ?

From a short novel by Stephen King Rated MA Hoyts Ai an that PART from ungainly title sticks to the mouth like toffee, The Shawshank Redemp- \"twn makes all the right decisions. A prison movie that masquerades as a character film while turning out to be something else (in a climax which no critic should reveal), The Shawshank Redemption is adapted from a 1982 Stephen King novella, Rita Hay worth and The Shawshank Redemption. One of King\\'s straight literary works (like Stand By Me), the novella apparently shows little traces of the horror-fantasy genre for which he is better known. Frank Darabont, a young Hollywood rewrite man (Nightmare on Elm Street III, The Blob, Mary Shelley s Frankenstein), seized on its rich character and plot pickings to make an epic Hollywood big picture that puts him into the top league of American writer-director talent.\\nFrom the hardboiled opening, we know we\\'re in the hands of a fine pulp thriller storyteller. Dishevelled and drunk, a wealthy young Maine banker, Andy Duf-resne (Tim Robbins), loads a revolver from inside his car and steps out into the night The period is 1947 and by the time the opening credits have rolled, the expression- less Dufresne has been handed two life sentences in Shawshank Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. A magnificent long aerial shot (complemented by the final, great fly-away image that book-ends the film) contrasts freedom with the ant-like men running against the dank gothic stones of Shawshank (the name being like the clang of iron gates and the shuffle of boots). Shawshank is a gulag of lifers and hard felons who, true to prison codes, never reveal what got them there: the joke is that they\\'re all \"innocent\" and in this sense Dufresne \"fits right in\". This makes it easier to identify with them against the screws, particularly the.Nazi-like Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), hitman for the sinister Christian fundamentalist Warden Norton (played with a beady-eyed calm by Bob Gunton).\\nIt\\'s a familiar prison movie scenario but it\\'s given an unusual spin by the narration of an involved outsider, Red (Morgan Freeman), a lifer whose applications for parole form a grim running gag through the film. Dufresne is regularly raped by the shower predators but it\\'s his financial skills rather than his fists that fight them. From working in the laundry to laundering the works, the self-contained, white-collar Dufresne, his survival of rapes, bashings and solitary confinement, and his friendship with the fixer, Red, and his clique, make a strange story of redemption and revenge, incarceration and freedom. Spoken by Morgan Film ANNA MARIA DELL\\'OSO Freeman as if he has all the time in the world, Red\\'s voiceover not only holds the plot together over a few decades but it creates a subtle alienation effect that disarms the threat of sentiment and the unbelievable though at times Shawshank runs close to melodrama, with images of captive pet birds, a musty jail library and some slick moral set speeches about hope and spiritual freedom. In some scenes jail almost starts to feel like a boys\\' high school.\\nBut none of it really seems to matter in the grand arc of the film\\'s ambitions: it\\'s originality is in its fresh, vital treatment of classic themes and if it breaks a few rules of the well-made, understated film, we mostly don\\'t care. In fact, the film\\'s generous and reckless rorftantic gestures come as a relief against constrained subtlety, particularly as there is scarcely a boring scene in the film. Robbins and Freeman make a compelling duo: Robbins plays the role of the poker-faced, vice-presidential Dufresne with impressive range and skill but it\\'s Freeman who fills the screen with his foxy confidence and ironic resignation. We hang on to every word of his character as we swing between hope and fear hope that we\\'re watching a survival story, that it will be something like Solzhenitsyn\\'s gulag novel. One Day In Tlie Life of Ivan Denisov-ich, while fearing it will become One Flew Over Tlie Cuckoo s Nest.\\nBut Darabont\\'s film is complex and surprising; he makes the most of Stephen King\\'s thoroughly \\'80s interpretation of the term \"insider trading\", fashioning a prison movie without the plot-pushers of breakouts, riots and the spectre of prisoners on death row. Like Double Indemnity, most of the essential information in The Shawshank Redemption is hidden from the viewer while we are allowed only the limited point-of-view of the narrator. Old-fashioned enough to be steeped in American film and literary traditions from Frank Capra to Walt Whitman and Thomas Wolfe, yet modern enough to know why accountancy is not boring, The Shawshank Redemption plays like a Grand Canyon Suite of crime and punishment, patience and revenge, innocence and corruption. Indeed, the original music (credited to Thomas Newman) contributes greatly to the film, particularly the unusual dissonances in the last act, followed by a rich hymnal Samuel Barber-style of American symphonic music (set to the rural scenes). The slightly overblown moral grandeur of the film\\'s themes are kept in check by its non-explicit but psychologically tough violence.\\nLarger than life, The Shawshank Redemption might at times get close to cliche for those with astringent tastes but it comes together brilliantly as an expansive and heartfelt hymn to the old-fashioned virtues of patience and rat-cunning. Hypocrisy and hokum MILK MONEY Written by John Mattson Directed by Richard Benjamin Rated M GU on George MILK Money, an infantile and sad sex-comedy that should go straight to video release, is only worth watching on the big screen if you are writing a thesis on middle-American sexual hypocrisy in the 1990s. Otherwise, forget it An Australian audience raised on Number 96\\'s suburban TV nudity before dinner decades ago is probably not going to get giggly about a Pretty Woman rip-off where a middle-American boy and his designer-clothed friends pool their \"milk money\" to get a downtown prostitute (played by Melanie Griffith) to show them her breasts. Breasts. Nothing more.\\nBut just in case the moral majority should get upset about this pre-teen pitched film, the hero stays a virgin. As Melanie slips off her bra, he closes his eyes and thinks of his beloved mother who died in childbirth. That the boys are confused by sex is fair enough. That American women have one of the highest caesarian rates in the Western world and are highly unlikely to die in childbirth without suing their obstetrician and hospital for millions is something that is glossed over by the filmmakers. But what sends Milk Money into the twilight zone of execrable filmmaking is its incompetent script that blends a prurient 1950s sitcom view of sex with every hokey cliche from an absent-minded father to an evil pimp and 10-year-olds overacting The Patty Duke Show\\'s idea of teen love.\\nThe film is only funny if you live in a world where children grow up to believe that breasts are wicked, that nudity is obscene and sex unspeakable; where school personal development classes consist of technical drawings and not the sophisticated discussions kids get nowadays, at least in this country\\'s public schools. But to really get the most out of Milk Money you have to believe that Bad Girls as played by Melanie Griffiths really want to be Good Girls wearing floral dresses in leafy suburbs. Despite the charismatic Ed Harris and the breathless Monroe-like Griffiths, the film flakes and crumbles into cornflake confusion to end in a soggy psychosexual mess on the suburban breakfast nook floor. You wonder whether everyone from the executive producer downwards needs to go into therapy..\\nAustralia\\nNew South Wales\\nSydney\\nThe Sydney Morning Herald\\n1995\\nFeb\\n16\\nPage 14\\nThe Shawshank Redemption / Milk Money\\nSubscribe\\nGift Subscriptions\\nHelp\\nSite Map\\nAbout\\nFish Wrap—Official Blog\\nAffiliates\\nContent Providers\\nUnited States (English)\\nVisit our other sites\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nInstagram\\n© 2024 Newspapers.com™ by Ancestry®.

The depravity of the prison world in something like \"American Me\" gets replaced with old-fashioned notions of friendship, even hope. In other words, the film feels tremendously outdated and unrealistic. Simplistic, almost embarrassingly so.\\nBut if you\\'re looking for fairy tales it\\'s still sort of a nice one. jusi aon t taKe your children to it. Even fairy tales get fairly bloodied in prison. Based on a short novel by Stephen King titled \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,\" the film has got all the right fairy tale ingredients: there are the good prisoners and the bad prisoners with nothing in between; the evil warden; a fairy godmother; and a storyteller, Red, played by Freeman, who narrates the plot. If you\\'re looking for fairy tales, \\'Shawshank\\' is still sort of a nice one.\\nJust don\\'t take your children to it. Even fairy tales get fairly bloodied in prison. Review WHAT: \\'The Shawshank Redemption\\' WHO: Tim Robbins, Mor-9an Freeman WHERE: 41 $t Avenue Playhouse, 41st Avenue and CapHola Road, Capitola INFORMATION: 474-8841 HOW GOOD?: C The fairy godmother role, thoueh. is somewhat linrnnuon. tional: Andy (played by an always impressive Tim Robbins) has been sent to Shawshank Penitentiary for riddling his wife and her lover with .38 caliber bullets.\\nFrom the beginning, it\\'s never clear whether he\\'s guilty of these crimes. The film opens with Robbins sitting stone-faced in his car, grasping a half-empty bottle of bourbon in one hand and a pistol in the other. He\\'s never actually shown committing the crime. Following a short trial, the judge brands him \"icy and remorseless\" and sentences him to two consecutive life terms in prison. Enter prison.\\nIt\\'s 1947. For the first two years, Robbins gets repeatedly raped and beaten by the prison bad guys. That is until one day he provides the head prison guard with some sound financial planning he used to be a banker in his former life and the warden quickly latches on to him. He\\'s much too valuable to be left to the prison bullies. Soon the convicted murderer is providing financial planning to almost the entire staff of the prison and some under-the-table advice for the warden\\'s own swindling schemes as well.\\nFrom the beginning you just know there is something different about Robbins, Freeman tells us. Maybe it\\'s the way he would take leisurely strolls across the prison yard. Maybe it\\'s the way he kept Morgan Freeman and Tim distant from the others Thpn again, it could have been his intricate knowledge of the state tax laws, his love of geology, his ability to use words like \"obtuse\" without blinking or just his basic honest nature. Whatever it is, this guy definitely isn\\'t supposed to be here. The prisoners don\\'t realize right away that Robbins is their fairy godmother, but that, too, soon becomes apparent.\\nHe quickly starts granting their wishes. After a hard day of labor in the sun, Robbins manages to get beers for all his pals \"on the house\" from the guards. A miracle in itself. Next, he builds the best prison library in the entire system at Shawshank. And helps a dozen or so prisoners pass their high school equivalency exams.\\nAnother time, he even manages to blast opera across the prison yard bringing a touch of beauty for just a moment into the lives of the dispossessed. Robbins brings a certain grace to his fairy-tale like role. At times you can almost see the halo hovering over his head. His characteristic small grin and lanky persona are somehow awe inspiring just like they\\'re supposed to be. His best friend and cohort, Freeman, is a natural born narrator.\\nUnfortunately, most of the poetry-infused narration doesn\\'t reach beyond cliche. He\\'s forced to keep saying things like \"Some birds \"A darino. dazzlfno nipr nf film ma Linn Robbins find hope, beauty and sincerity were never meant to be caged \" The narration of the film, like the film itself, romanticizes prison, and glosses over the prisoners crimes. This is a film about prison camaraderie, about friendship, about hope. There\\'s good times to be had, just don\\'t expect any realism here.\\nSCREEN I -At 7:00- THE SPECIALIST m -At 9:00- FRESH (R) SCREEN II -At 7:00- THE RIVER WILD (PG13) -At 9:00- EXIT TO EDEN ,r, E BANANA SLUG\\'S IN SHOW BIZ PULP FICTION (R) (12 301 (3 45 7 16 10 30 NO VIPS UNTIL 10f28 \\' RADIOLAND MURDERS IPG: (1 451 (3 1015 20 7 50 10 10 NO VIPS UNTIL 114 QUIZ SHOW PGi3) (1 00 4 0O 7 00 10 05 THE SPECIALIST (Ri 11 301 14 30)7 40 10 15 LOVE AFFAIR 10211. 5 30 7 30 9 45 NO VIPS UNTIL 114.\\nUnited States\\nCalifornia\\nSanta Cruz\\nSanta Cruz Sentinel\\n1994\\nOct\\n21\\nPage 41\\nThe Shawshank Redemption\\nSubscribe\\nGift Subscriptions\\nHelp\\nSite Map\\nAbout\\nFish Wrap—Official Blog\\nAffiliates\\nContent Providers\\nUnited States (English)\\nVisit our other sites\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nInstagram\\n© 2024 Newspapers.com™ by Ancestry®.

James Whitmore Written and directed by: Frank Darabont . Rating: AA Playjng at: World Exchange, Britannia By Jay Stone Citizen movies writer Tlie Sliawshank Redemption is an exceptionally fine film, a prison movie that transcends the form. Like Vie Birdman of Aka-traz or Vie Great Escape movies that it salutes in passing it goes beyond the walls and becomes a story about the human spirit. Based on a short story by Stephen King (the King of Stand By Me rather than the monster-horror version), Vie Shawshank Redemption is a tale about friendship and survival.\\nIt\\'s also, we hasten to add, a tale about prisons: This is an engaging and compulsively watchable mystery story that is both frightening and funny. There is sentiment in Shaivshank, but there is very little sentimentality. Shawsliank starts with a murder. Mild-mannered investment banker Andy Defresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of killing his wife and her lover and sentenced to life in Shawshank State Prison. It\\'s 1947, and although the ethnic gangs have not yet taken over America\\'s jails, prison life is brutal.\\nAs Andy and his fellow prisoners march into Shawshank, the seasoned cons place bets on who will be the first to crack when the cell doors slam shut behind them. \"Rule No. 1, no blasphemy,\" Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) tells the new arrivals. \"The other rules you\\'ll figure out as you go along.\" And it doesn\\'t take long. When one prisoner asks when lunch is served, he\\'s bludgeoned by sadistic Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), the head guard.\\nAndy is picked to be an early casualty, but he is more resilient than he looks, and he eventually becomes friends with Red (Morgan Freeman), a prison fixer who can get you anything from a pack of cigarettes to a rock hammer. Vie Shaivsliank Redemption follows their friendship for 20 years, through the small acts of transcendent kindness to the casual brutal-itieS.;of jail life. This is not a bloodthirsty movie, but it has moments of frightening violence, most of them fhyblvrng a gang of rapists who prey on other prisoners. Most of it ; is not shown, although there is an early\" scene of a prisoner being - beaten by a guard, filmed with a stationary camera in a scene that will remind you of the Rodney King video. In that atmosphere, Sliawshank becomes a film about spaces as well: The confinement of solitary, the nightmarish tiers of the cells, the restrictions against which prisoners push themselves until, suddenly, they are free and find themselves lost in the vast real world where the walls are too far apart.\\nDirector Frank Darabont, a veteran screenwriter making his first movie, has a sure touch. The prison itself is one of the characters in the movie, and Darabont defines its geography in a great scene in which the camera moves over the cathedral-like buildings and down into the dangers of the yard. Darabont also gets fine performances all around. Freeman is the engine of the movie, the narrator and prison-wise lifer who has surrendered hope but not humanity. Freeman keeps Red under superb control.\\nRobbins is just as good as Andy, the banker who finds his knowledge of tax rules are as useful as an extra carton of cigarettes (\"I\\'m a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning.\") After a series of showy roles in such films as The Hudsucker Proxy and The Player parts in which he says he was acting on his toes Robbins settles back onto his heels for Andy and gives a performance of quiet power. Much of the Shawsliank mystery takes place in Andy\\'s head, and Robbins lets us in so\\' subtly that by the end we feel we\\'ve known him all our lives. As in all prison movies, Shawshank Prison is populated by types James Whitmore\\'s richly textured Brooks, a long-time con who keeps a bird as a pet the brutal guards; the godlike warden but the story never allows them to become cliches. Our sympathies shift with the years, and we\\'re never sure of how we feel about Warden Norton, for instance, or Captain Hadley. It changes with events; we become fellow prisoners, enobled by Andy\\'s courage, strengthened by his dream of \"a warm place with no memory,\" inspired by the flight of Vie Marriage of Figaro that one day fills the prison yard.\\nBy the end, we come to appreciate the craft of King\\'s storytelling so much that we are willing to overlook several plot holes that threaten to twist the movie into a fairy tale. Vie Sliawshank Redemption sells us on its message of hope: by being a great prison film, it becomes a film about more than prisons..\\nCanada\\nOntario\\nOttawa\\nThe Ottawa Citizen\\n1994\\nOct\\n07\\nPage 45\\nThe Shawshank Redemption\\nSubscribe\\nGift Subscriptions\\nHelp\\nSite Map\\nAbout\\nFish Wrap—Official Blog\\nAffiliates\\nContent Providers\\nUnited States (English)\\nVisit our other sites\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nInstagram\\n© 2024 Newspapers.com™ by Ancestry®.

The Shawshank Redemption is an intelligent treat for adults, not the least because it takes that done-todeath theme - unlikely friendship between prison inmates and delivers a richly textured, deeply personal moral fable. Like all great dramas, the whole is greater than the sum of the (very good) parts. Seamless directing from film first-timer Frank Darabont blends with impeccable acting and an intriguing concept, based on Stephen King\\'s novella. Those adults who enjoyed Stand By Me, the screen version of another King story, will find a similarly expert contrast of affectionately observed characters with tough-edged action.\\nThe story has that easy confidence of the work of a master storyteller who knows how to build up fascinating character profiles gradually without elaborate monologues or by bending the audience into shape. Using the classic bracket of voice-over narration, Shawshank opens in 1947 with long-time prison inmate \"Red\" Redding (Freeman) reflecting on his first encounter with new inmate Andy Dufresne (Robbins). Andy has been convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover. He claims he\\'s innocent but as Red quickly informs him, so does every other prisoner in brutal maximum security Shawshank State Prison. T\\'S a real pleasure to SURVIVAL: Tim Robbins as Pessimistic Red doesn\\'t expect white-collar accountant Andy to survive for long, especially after the latter\\'s savage initiation.\\nBut Andy does survive, turning apparent drawbacks (more brains than brawn) into assets in this violent world. Watching him over the years, Red begins to reassess his own philosophy that nothing can ever change for an inmate. For the first time in a long time, he feels something akin to hope. You\\'d expect top notch dramatic work from Driving Miss Daisy Oscar Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman nominee Freeman; his serenely humane Red injects a crucial note of warmth into an otherwise relentlessly bleak setting. But it\\'s the left-field casting of the always distinctive Robbins which spins Shawshank out of the ordinary into the memorable, much as Tom Hanks did for Forrest Gump.\\n. It\\'s impossible to imagine any other actor fitting the part as well as Robbins does Andy. He makes Andy vulnerable enough to be an instantly identifiable underdog hero but backed with as Red Redding inside the stony walls enough gritted-teeth stubbornness to make him compelling to watch. That\\'s the real trick to Shawshank - characters who are punchily believable enough to be interesting but also likeable enough to make viewers feel consistently pleased to stay with them to the deeply satisfying conclusion. Language and violence certainly exclude all but adult viewers.\\nThey will be reassured to note that the action is shrewdly placed, explicit enough to make poignant points about man\\'s inhumanity to man but not graphic of Shawshank State Prison. enough to turn the stomach. It\\'s also refreshing to see &amp; men-in-chains film which doesn\\'t depict its male characters gaily bouncing back after a beating with nary a bruise. Shawshank\\'s consistent refusal to exploit the prison setting for cheap thrills, coupled with its deeply touching and unexpectedly upbeat faith in the power of friendship, is enough to put most other prison dramas to shame.

On throne side is a black man in prison for life on a murder conviction; he believes hope is dangerous. \"It can make a man insane.\" Another man, a white banker serving two life sentences for \"two murders, believes hope is what makes life bearable. The two men. Red (Morgan Freeman) and Andy (Tim Robbins), are also the most intelligent prisoners we see at Shawshank Prison in Maine, so they not surprisingly become friends.\\nWe spend about 20 years watching their friendship grow, from 1946 to 1967. Every 10 years. Red shows up for a parole hearing, and every 10 years, his request is rejected. By his 30th year of incarceration. Red figures he\\'s \"institutionalized\" so used to prison life, he couldn\\'t function outside.\\nRed\\'s resigned. Andy is not resigned. Andy was a successful banker married to a beautiful woman before he was convicted of murdering her and her golf pro lover. He says he\\'s innocent, and he spends his prison years lwking for a way out. When he hits the 20-year mark and he finds a way out, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" picks up real steam.\\nA not-so-subtle subtext of the story is that being black, Red is more likely to give up hope, while white men like Andy never lose their fighting spirit. The story, adapted from a Stephen King novella, is told in voice-over by Freeman\\'s Red, and it end- ,.ith a brisk, satisfying punch line It\\'s an odd movie. It really does run too long two hours and 22 minutes and you do feel the length. There are too many repetitions of Andy being brutalized by a vicious clique called the \"sisters,\" straight men who rape and beat their victims. There are too many meal chats among the half dozen buddies that make up the inner circle of Andy and \"THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION,\" starring Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and Bob Gunton, will be previewed tomorrow at selected area theaters.\\nFrank Darabont vrote and directed. A Columbia Pictures release. Rated R for violence, profanity, sex. (out of 4) Red. And the prison warden (Bob Gun-ton) and chief of guards (Clancy Brown) are such brazen meanies, they\\'re almost laughable.\\nAnd I wonder how many people will keep a straight face when Andy, bucking the sadistic warden, hooks up the prison\\'s loudspeaker system to a recording of Mozart\\'s \"The Marriage of Figaro,\" and the prisoners, hearing this transcendent music, stop in their tracks, stand at attention and look heavenward. Still, director-writer Frank Darabont has a very good way with his cast. He lets the understated rhythm of the Freeman and Robbins performances set the tone, so the movie has a solid, steady feel to it. Robbins and Freeman are so comfortable together you believe in their relationship, which is essential for staying with the film. Andy and Red might not in reality have hit it off so handily, but these actors are assured enough to overcome the stretch.\\nAndy\\'s authentically grim cell is the locale of a very clever joke that Dara-t bont draws out nicely, so that when he delivers the punch line, you\\'re stunned that you missed what seems obvious after the fact. And the film has a lovely show business gesture in it: Darabont gives veteran James Whitmore the role of the prison librarian, Brooks Hatlen. It\\'s a relatively small but meaty role, and as you watch Whitmore shuffle around in his old man\\'s gait, you realize that Darabont is saying there\\'s still life to an exceptional, long career. There\\'s no argument about where Darabont stands on the hope issue..\\nUnited States\\nNew Jersey\\nAsbury Park\\nAsbury Park Press\\n1994\\nSep\\n30\\nPage 34\\nThe Shawshank Redemption\\nSubscribe\\nGift Subscriptions\\nHelp\\nSite Map\\nAbout\\nFish Wrap—Official Blog\\nAffiliates\\nContent Providers\\nUnited States (English)\\nVisit our other sites\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nInstagram\\n© 2024 Newspapers.com™ by Ancestry®.

There are town bullies in it, but not a drug dealer in sight. - Any kid would kill to have parents as great as Lockie\\'s, and there are two of them, too. No wonder Lockie\\'s so good, and he\\'s also a Christian.\\nHe\\'s also the working-class underdog who can\\'t articulate his feelings about Vicki\\'s money-obsessed parents, but instinctively dislikes them. He\\'s even got a dad who, as town policeman, can deal with the bogans who bash Lockie by putting their ute off the road. It\\'s a bit of a fairy tale, but it does succeed in making us all feel good. Strong themes create a classic Film The Shawshank Redemption . Hoyts, Brighton Bay, Knox Showcase.\\nThe Shawshank Redemption, based on a non-horror novella by Stephen King, is both a classic prison film and a superior movie. The acting is flawless, the script engrossing and the direction strong. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a Maine banker, a seemingly gentle guy who receives a double life sentence (back-to-back) for killing his unfaithful wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank where he befriends Red (Morgan Freeman), who has already endured 20 years of a life sentence for murder. Red admits his guilt, while Andy proclaims his innocence.\\nI Life at Shawshank follows the rituals depicted in countless other prison dramas. The prisoners are treated brutally, the food is tub-standard, cigarettes are scarce, cells are small and bare. There are also the stock characters. Although professing to be a religious man, the warder is calculating sadist who shows no mercy. A vicious prisoner called Bogs, who is the leader of a gang called the \"Sisters\", takes a fancy to Andy and regularly beats and rapes him.\\nAndy\\'s only salvation is his growing friendship with Red. The story of Andy and Red, which stretches from 1345 to 1967, is narrated by the Morgan Freeman character. Two themes are obvious: the damaging effects of prison and the possibility that even in prison a man can abide by his own moral code. There is a third theme, however, expressed more subtly, which concerns the love between Red and Andy. Although their relationship is strictly platonic, it is clear that Red adores Andy.\\nWhen Andy takes over the loudspeaker system and engulfs the prison with a song from The Marriage of Figaro, Red is overcome with emotion. A number of references to the notion of \"inside\" and \"outside\" run through the story. The prisoners are on the \"inside\"; many do not want to return to the \"outside\"; the warden says that salvation is \"within\"; and Andy says he has a place \"inside that they can\\'t touch\". The true \"inside\" in the film\\'s story is the love which develops between Andy and Red and which becomes more obvious as the film moves towards its surprising conclusion. The film\\'s irony is that redemption at Shawshank comes not through \"discipline and the Lord\" but through love.\\nHollywood tries and fails, again Film Speechless Greater Union and suburban cinemas ADRIAN MARTIN THE SEARCH for a modern romantic comedy continues with Speechless.

All of those old prison-movie cliches are redeemed By JACK GARNER STAFF FILM CRITIC II f you like prison movies, youll feel j right at home when the cell door U clangs shut in The Shawshank Redemption. Youll be on familiar turf as writer-director Frank Darabont serves up the sadistic warden, the worldly-wise veteran prisoners, the frightened newcomers, the con-artist convict who runs a black market out of his cell, the ominous rapists waiting in the showers, the brutal guards. Prisons thrive on regimentation and so do prison movies. Heck, The Shawshank Redemption includes an aged lifer running the musty prison library, and he even takes care of a sickly bird! All they failed to do was cast Burt Lancaster in the role. But Darabont\\'s daring scheme for The Shawshank Redemption is not to ignore the cliches.\\nInstead, he embraces them, then moves well beyond them. In adapting Stephen King\\'s 1982 novella, Darabont enriched his characters with fine touches and colorful traits. He populated his story with fascinating people and then found some of the day\\'s best actors to play them. They\\'re led by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, and neither has ever been better. For the role of the book- and bird-lover, Darabont gave James Whitmore his first movie part in eight years, and the 73-year-old actor proves he\\'s not ready for a pasture, even if it\\'s fertilized with Miracle-Gro.\\nDarabont\\'s other trick is to weave an immensely clever plot through what at first seems to be a character study. At first, the intricacies of the story are barely discernible. But by film\\'s end, it packs an emotional wallop unlike any you\\'ve experienced at the movies this year. Though I won\\'t tell you how, the good finally are rewarded, the bad are punished and a character we\\'ve come to love is, indeed, redeemed. All in all, The Shawshank Redemption is the best prison movie since Jimmy Cagney and Humphrey Bogart were behind bars.\\nThat might explain why Darabont fought hard for the right to make his directorial debut with this screenplay. Darabont knew what he wanted and he appears to have gotten it. The film offers rich, dark images to match its vivid emotions. And every character is memorably delineated, from the Bible-thumping warden (Bob Guhton) to a V.

At one end of the spectrum are Hollywood potboilers ranging from the classic 20,000 Years in Sing-Sing to the trashy Tango &amp; Cash and the witty Escape From Alcatraz. At the opposite end are metaphorical films using imprisonment to explore issues of guilt, salvation, and freedom. The Shawshank Redemption, starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, leans toward the second group - which is surprising, since it's a high-profile Hollywood release with a story based on a Stephen King novella. The picture has moments of Kingstyle sensationalism, to be sure, and one subplot (about a gang of 37957 3 65 A Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins play the two main characters in the Shawshank Redemption homosexual predators) seems gratuitous.\\nMuch of the time, though, the film-makers find more interesting things to focus on than the claustrophobic brutality of most prison movies; and there's no quarreling with their message that hope, trust, and friendship are among the most powerful of human values. The film takes its title from Shawshank State Prison, a maximum-security jail run by a Bible-quoting warden who's as corrupt as he is sanctimonious. The story begins when a banker named Andy arrives after being convicted of a double murder. He maintains his innocence, but nobody cares about him or his protestations. Slowly accepting the prison and its routines, he finds consolation in small pleasures an interest in geology, a good memory for music - and starts to make friends.\\nChief among his new acquaintances is Red, a longtime con with a capitalistic flair for providing items his fellow prisoners want. Drawn together by their nose for business, their ironic outlook on life, and their basic sense of decency, Andy and Red become close companions, wending their way together toward the story's surprising and upbeat climax. Written and directed by Frank Darabont, whose previous credits lie mostly in TV and horror movies, The Shawshank Redemption has a clever plot, conveyed through a well-crafted screenplay that loses momentum only when twists and turns stretch it about 30 minutes too long. What gives the picture most of its zest and poignancy, however, is the excellence of its lead performances. As the uptight banker, Robbins does some of his subtlest acting to date.\\nAs his hardened but resilient friend, Freeman is simply miraculous, giving the role so much depth, dignity, and good humor that you feel you've known this man forever. It's the kind of deeply felt performance that Freeman does better than anyone else, and if reward matches achievement, he should win about a dozen Oscars for it. Also central to the movie's success is superb camera work by Roger Deakins. Other contributors include production designer Terence Marsh, costume designer Elizabeth McBride, film editor Richard Francis-Bruce, and composer Thomas Newman. The solid supporting cast includes Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, William Sadler, and the marvellous James Whitmore in a brief but memorable appearance as the oldest con in the joint.\\nThe Christian Science Monitor Quick Flicks will be back next week..\\nCanada\\nBritish Columbia\\nVictoria\\nTimes Colonist\\n1994\\nOct\\n13\\nPage 54\\nThe Shawshank Redemption\\nSubscribe\\nGift Subscriptions\\nHelp\\nSite Map\\nAbout\\nFish Wrap—Official Blog\\nAffiliates\\nContent Providers\\nUnited States (English)\\nVisit our other sites\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nInstagram\\n© 2024 Newspapers.com™ by Ancestry®.

Last week, Peter Jackson, hitherto known only for adolescent taste-lessness, came up with Heaumly Creatures. This week, Shekhar Kapur, a 50-year-old director of Bombay movies, none of which has been shown outside the subcontinent, has given us the boldest and best Indian film in a decade. And Frank Darabont, screenwriter on such clinkers as The Fly and Mary Shelley\\'s Frankenstein, makes his directorial debut with one of the best American films of the past couple of years. Scripted by Mala Sen, Kapur\\'s Bandit Queen tells the true story of Phoolan Devi, the village girl from the impoverished state of Uttar Pradesh who rebelled against her humiliating treatment as a low-caste woman and became a dacoit or bandit.\\nA 15-minute pre-credit sequence deals with her sale as a child bride in 1968, her punishment for daring to answer her high-caste tormentors, and her rape at the age of n by her callous husband. The rest of the movie concentrates on the four years leading up to her surrender in 1983, during which, accepting her role as an outcast, Phoolan rose to be a bandit leader. She exacted terrible revenge on those who used rape as a political wi sis8\" weapon to degrade and humiliate her, and she brought hope and pride to the exploited and downtrodden. Bandit Queen is, firstly, a lucid narrative about injustice, as exciting as a Peckinpah western and as sharply observant of rural folkways as a film by Satyajit Ray. The arid landscape of scrub and deep ravines is a resonant setting, at once awesome and protective, and Kapur uses the imposing road and railway bridges that cross this wilderness both as part of his drama and to suggest the way modern India passes so indifferently through this feudal world.\\nThe director himself makes his brief telling appearance as a sneering sexist lorry driver who gets the butt of Phoolan\\'s rifle in his face. Second, the movie is about the creation of an ou,tiav hero on the : lines of Robin tyood or Jesse James, and of how Phoolan (superbly and\\' courageously impersonated by Seema Biswas) grows with her legend. Third, S,en and Kapur use Phoolan\\'s career to anatomise a whole society(: the vvay.\\'Francesqo Rosi did with tl?c life ofa comparable Sicilian social bandit in the Marxist classic\\' SalvatQreGiiiHanq (ig6i), V Policies hatched in a circumspect; \\' mealy-mouthed manner in a government office in Delhi arc shown being lethally discharged on the dusty streets of a village in Utiai Pradesh. Bandit Queen is a work of ft W - t mm . i A controlled indignation that, like Rosi\\'s film, shows how politicians, criminals and the police conspire to preserve a status quo that a nation officially disavows.\\n. Bandit Queen ends with Phoolan Devi going to jail, and by all accounts she had a pretty terrible 12 years inside. Frank Darabont\\'s The Shawshank Redemption is a jail movie in a classic Hollywood mode and it too is about injustice, hypocrisy and the preservation of personal dignity. His script is based on a rather good Stephen King novella and has two heroes. One is the film\\'s narrator Red (Morgan Freeman), a middle-aged convict Bandit Queen s as exciting as a Peckinpah western, as observant as a film by Satjayit Ray serving a life sentence for murder at Maine\\'s Shawshank State Prison.\\nThe other is Andy (Tim Robbins), . a young banker given two life sentences in 1,947 for killing his. wife and her lover. Andy had iconteniplated the crime, but professes his innocence ahfl the picture covers\\' his zo year of incarceration, the influence he has oh his fellpw nmatcs, and his friendship with Red. Darabont directs with authority, cutting rapidly wheri he needs to, but mostly creating a deliberate pace that draws Us into an enclosed .world of oppressive routine.\\nHis touch is firm but supple, and while there\\'s plenty of laughter, it Isn\\'t the sort known as comic relief. Freeman makes a substantial figure T jjj 1 Tim Robbins, left, and Morgan Freeman do time in The Shawshank Redemption of the humane, ironic Red, a youthful killer grown into a man of wisdom and probity. Andy is a more complex character, venose mystery and inner life Robbins skilfully projects without making him appear priggish. Andy uses his gifts as a financial expert to manipulate the sadistic guards and the crooked warden (\\'i had to come to prison to become a criminal\\', he remarks) but at times he defies them to his considerable cost. While attaining a form of spiritual transcendence, he shows how humanity can be brought to an uncaring institution, and he proves that hope, friendship and fellow-feeling are more important to survival than a brutal Darwinian fitness.\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is a fine example of cinematic storytelling, and it\\'s highly satisfying in the way it fulfils traditional expectations while providing plausible surprises. The casting is immaculate, right down to the last gnarled old convict (there\\'s a marvellous performance from the craggy James Whitrnore as the jail\\'s oldest inmate). The British clnematographer Roger Deakihs gives the picture a stylish penumbra! ; look somewhere between Gustave Dord and Edward Hopper, Thomas Newman\\'s efFcctjve score artfully incorporates n duet from The Marriqae of Figaro and the Ink Spots\\' version of \\'If I Didn\\'t Care\\', The late Jessica Tandy\\'made her final appearance at the age of 87 in Deepa Mehra\\'s Camilla, a thinly plotted Canadian road movie tracing the developing friendship between the octogenarian violinist Camilla (Tandy) and an insecure young folk-music composer (Bridget Fonda) as they journey from Georgia to Toronto. There is considerable . poignancy in the way Tandy\\'s piercing blue eyes look unflinchingly at us from that handsome, expressive face.\\nHer presence is as strong and as vulnerable as a steel-spring that we know is near uncoiling. Two scenes are especially touching. The most obvious is a reunion between Camilla and her long-lost lover, played by Hume Cronyn, Tandy\\'s husband since 1942. There is such playful tenderness between them. The other scene, almost unbearably poignant, occurs on a beach in Georgia.\\nWithout a touch of self-consciousness, Camilla strips naked and encourages Fonda to join her in the sea. Three animal movies have arrived for half-term, the least of which is the Australian director George Miller\\'s Andre, a sentimental tale of the friendship between a seal and a little girl in a Maine fishing port back in innocent old ig62. It\\'s as wholesome as white, sliced bread with added preservative, but somewhat offensive in the way the seal is turned into a performer. Far better, though even more determinedly anthropomorphic is Caroline Thompson\\'s handsomely designed and photographed Black Beauty, a respectful adaptation of the children\\'s novel written in 1878 by the quaker author iVnna Sewell. It\\'s about the life and hard times of a horse (his thoughts voiced by the Scottish actor Alan Cumming) as he passes from owner to owner, moving from the idyllic English countryside to a hellish Victoria city, experiencing love, cruelty and injustice.\\nThe working-class are kindly; the upper-classes insensitive to, and exploitative of, both man and beast. It\\'s not exactly on a par with Bresson\\'s Au Hasard Balthazar, but it will have the kids in tears and leaving the cinema demanding the retention of Clause Four and determined to vote Labour when they\\'re 18. Children will most enjoy Rudyard Kipling\\'s The Jungle Book, despite (or more likely because of) the fact that it\\'s nearer to being a cross between a Turzan film, Aladdin and a Temple of Doom imperial adventure yarn than to Kipling\\'s didactic Bildunflsroman. It is crude, old-fashioned stuff but the Indian settings are spectacular. Kids who have seen Disney\\'s cartoon version will note in-jokes like the kindly doctor (John Cieese) commending to Mowgli \\'the bare necessities of life\\' and die leader of the apes being called Lxrd Louis after Louis Prima.\\nBandit Queen (119 mlns, 18) Cu\\'rzpn WeSt End, Screen on the Green and general release The Shawshank Redemption (143 mlns, 15) Odeon Leicester Square Camilla (94 mlns, PG) MGM Shaftesbury Ave Andre (94 mlns, U) MGM Trocadero and general release Black Beauty (88 mlns, U) Warner West End and general release Rudyard Kipling\\'s The Jungle Book (114 mlns, PG) Odeon West End and general release.\\nUnited Kingdom\\nEngland\\nLondon\\nThe Observer\\n1995\\nFeb\\n19\\nPage 88\\nThe Shawshank Redemption / The Bandit Queen\\nSubscribe\\nGift Subscriptions\\nHelp\\nSite Map\\nAbout\\nFish Wrap—Official Blog\\nAffiliates\\nContent Providers\\nUnited States (English)\\nVisit our other sites\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nInstagram\\n© 2024 Newspapers.com™ by Ancestry®.

       "   'Critic': 'AD\\nBRIGHT\\nARTS & CULTURE\\nFILM & TV\\nPopcorn and Inspiration: ‘The Shawshank Redemption,’ a Prison Drama With Hope\\nFriends Read Free\\nSave\\nTim Robbins (L) and Morgan Freeman play characters who find friendship in a dark and hopeless prison. (Columbia Pictures)\\nBy Michael Clark\\n7/11/2021\\nUpdated:\\n7/16/2021\\nPrint\\nR | 2h 22min | Drama | 23 September 1994 (USA)\\nLike a handful of classics that came before this film—“The Wizard of Oz,” “It’s a Wonderful Life,” “Citizen Kane,” “Vertigo”—“The Shawshank Redemption” was a box office failure upon initial release. Yet, for the better part of the last 25 years, it’s been ranked No. 1 on the imdb.com Top 250 list and is on many critics’ all-time Top 10 lists. In the interest of full disclosure, it’s No. 6 on my all-time Top 10.\\nIn retrospect, the odds were stacked against the movie before it even left the gate. The title is clunky and offers no insight into the story. The story itself isn’t what most people consider to be appealing. Although leads Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were well-known to audiences, neither was (at the time) considered a guaranteed draw. The long running time, near-absence of female characters, and lack of action certainly didn’t help, and few audiences had ever heard of first-time director Frank Darabont.\\nThe Most-Rented Home-Video Title in the US in 1995\\nTen weeks after opening, the film had grossed a paltry $16 million domestically and, despite universal critical acclaim, was considered a colossal bomb. Things started looking up in early 1995 when the movie received seven Oscar nominations, including for Best Picture. A theatrical re-release soon followed and, along with a significant foreign box office take, the final worldwide gross hit a still-disappointing $58 million.\\nIn hindsight, the Warner Bros. decision to ship over 300,000 VHS tapes to rental chains in the spring was a huge gamble, but the Academy Award boost and strong word of mouth eventually resulted in the film’s becoming the most-rented title in the United States in 1995. Over the last quarter-century, it has played on 15 different basic cable channels. Tack on what sources at Warner Bros. have estimated at $80 million in home video sales, and the result is one of the most impressive aftermarket performances in movie history.\\nFrequently compared to “Cool Hand Luke” (1967) and “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” (1975), “The Shawshank Redemption” at its core is a story about resisting, yet perhaps not quite vanquishing, an oppressive authoritarian monolith. While the two leads in the previous films were clearly guilty of crimes to which they readily admit, former banker Andy Dufresne (Robbins) steadfastly claims that he did not murder his unnamed wife and her golf-pro lover.\\nPretty True to Stephen King’s Source Novella\\nAndy arrives at Maine’s Shawshank prison in the late 1940s. Red (Freeman), a convicted murderer and procurer of outside contraband, sizes him up and doesn’t think much of him. He bets his small circle of inmate friends that Andy will crack under pressure his first night. This doesn’t happen, and the two men slowly develop a bond that lasts decades.\\nIn adapting the Stephen King novella “Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,” Darabont doesn’t stray far from the source material, except to change the fates of three supporting characters. This significantly alters the tone of the narrative. The stakes become much higher, the viewer’s emotional investment richer, and the individual outcomes far more throttling and visceral.\\nWhat Darabont wisely didn’t alter was the narration from Red. Through him, viewers meet secondary and peripheral characters which, in a traditional format, would have taken dog years to address. Unlike in print, in the wrong hands film narration can come off as fussy, overindulgent, and intrusive. Freeman’s honey-drenched, voice-of-God baritone becomes a soothing balm. The commentary becomes a spiritual ointment that doesn’t replace live action but rather augments and deeply enhances it.\\nThe leisurely pace of the film, especially in the second act, is thoroughly fitting for a character-driven prison drama spanning nearly three decades. This does and will strike some viewers as tedious, which might have been part of King’s and Darabont’s ultimate intent. The drudgery of a monotonous daily routine takes place within the confines of a facility designed to crush the soul and remove all glimmer of hope under the guise of rehabilitation and is not meant to be experienced at a quick clip.\\nThis deliberate approach to storytelling rewards patient audiences. In scene after scene, Darabont leads us down one path only to switch gears and deliver the unexpected. We’re reasonably sure the story is headed to a cathartic conclusion. We want the story to live up to the last word in the title, but it’s never made clear or spoon-fed.\\nThrough hindsight and repeated viewings, audiences will appreciate the care and thoughtfulness Darabont poured into the screenplay. Foreshadowing, abundant clues, and towering character arcs all contribute to the methodical mission of Andy Dufresne. Beginning as a babe in the woods, Andy becomes an involuntary leader, a father figure, and even an ally of sorts to his demonic oppressors. He’s a steadfast humanitarian in a place where humanity barely exists.\\nThe only times when Andy and Red lock horns are when the former discusses the need to keep up hope. Andy maintains it’s the only thing that can’t be taken away, while Red argues that it is dangerous as it leads to more misery and unfulfilled pipe dreams.\\nWhatever the audience perceives as a lack of payoff and/or reward in the first two hours is more than compensated for in the final 20 minutes. The remaining story threads are resolved, and karma is duly administered. Darabont delivers an ending so poetic, so uplifting, and so heartwarming, it will move you to tears.\\nHope indeed springs eternal.\\n‘The Shawshank Redemption’\\nDirector: Frank Darabont\\nStars: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, James Whitmore, Gil Bellows\\nRunning Time: 2 hours, 22 minutes\\nRating: R\\nRelease Date: Sept. 23, 1994\\nRating: 5 out of 5\\nOriginally from Washington, D.C., Michael Clark has written for over 30 local and national film industry media outlets and is ranked in the top 10 of the Atlanta media marketplace.

A perfect example of this is his 1982 novella called Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.  Twelve years after it was published, The Shawshank Redemption, starring Tim Robbins (Bull Durham) as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman (The Dark Knight) as Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.  Almost thirty years later, the insightful and symbolic movie has been released in 4K for the first time.\\nIn 1947, Andy Dufresne was a big-time, hotshot banker in Portland, Maine until he was tried and convicted of the double murder of his wife and her lover.  Although he claimed innocence, Andy was sentenced to serve two life sentences in Shawshank Prison.  While there he becomes friends with Red, who is also in for murder.\\nWhen a new warden (Bob Gunton; 24), Samuel Norton, takes over, Andy is reassigned to help in the library, although he spends much of his time helping the prison staff in financial matters.  He also becomes Norton\\'s personal bookkeeper and Andy quickly realizes Norton is taking bribes.  After twenty years, Andy executes a daring escape, taking Norton\\'s ill-gotten funds with him to Mexico.  Learning from Andy, Red finally tells the truth when his next parole hearing comes up and he suddenly finds himself back in the real world.  Unable to adjust to freedom, Red remembers the postcard Andy sent him and heads to Mexico to join Andy.\\nThe entire cast of this movie is terrific with Robbins and Freeman leading the way.  They had a natural bond making their friendship believable and both men were transformed into their characters for the over two-hour running time.  Director Frank Darabont (The Green Mile) offers some interesting camera shots and a dreariness that permeates the movie even when the sun is shining.  His pacing is excellent, which is a good thing since the movie is so long, yet time feels like it flies by because the viewer is completely engrossed in the story.\\nThe film is definitely better because of the 4K upgrade. Details, like the prisoner/guard uniforms and the rain pouring down during Andy\\'s escape, show fine stitching and incredible clarity of the droplets.  Even though the color palette is intentionally muted, hues are deep and true and the brief bursts of color jump off the screen.\\nThe DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 is a little disappointing as it probably would have been worthwhile to transfer it over to Dolby Atmos to match the superior video quality.  However, the audio is still rich with ambient noise vibrating all around the room.  While the audio is very similar to the 2008 Blu-ray review, there are subtle differences to enjoy.\\nThe extras don\\'t offer anything new, besides Director\\'s commentary on both the Blu-ray and the 4K discs.  All the others are the same ones from the 2008 Blu-ray release.  They include Audio Commentary by Director Frank Darabont, Hope Springs Eternal: A Look Back at The Shawshank Redemption, Shawshank: The Redeeming Feature, The Sharktank Redemption, The Charlie Rose Show with Frank Darabont, Tim Robbins, and Morgan Freeman, Shawshank Stills, and Theatrical Re-release Trailer.

The point is that the things we hear, the stories we tell, are often clouded by memory, influenced by what’s popular. In the same way people misattribute this quote, so often do they argue as to the quality of Frank Darabont’s (The Green Mile) 1994 prison drama, adapted from a novella by Stephen King (The Shining). This film runs as frequently on cable network TNT as it is mentioned in the hallowed halls where cinema discourse takes place. While some find the film overrated and over-run, The Shawshank Redemption is the rare film which can be seen close to 40 times and is still not anywhere close to feeling to trite. That sense of newness, despite its familiarity after all this time, is getting a boost thanks to a 4K UHD restoration from Warner Bros. Home Entertainment on September 14th. Though it does not include any new bonus materials, the visual elements are so different thanks to the HDR inclusion that the film feels practically new.\\nL-R: Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd “Red” Redding and Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne in THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. (image not representative of 4K remaster.)\\nAfter being found guilty of killing his wife and her lover, banker Andy Dufresne is sent to Shawshank State Prison for two consecutive life sentences. There, he meets friendly fellow prisoners Red, Heywood (William Sadler), and Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), while trying to stay out of view of a degenerate gang called “the Sisters,” led by the malignant Bogs (Mark Rolston), and violent captain of the guard, Officer Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown). After working a gig repairing the roof creates an opportunity for Andy to help Officer Hadley with a financial matter, things slowly start to shift for the former banker, including putting him in a close vicinity with the warden, Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). Outside of prison, Andy walked the straight and narrow, but, inside, he became a criminal and found his own way to freedom.\\nIf you’re familiar with the film (and chances are, if you’re curious about the 4K UHD edition, you very familiar), the above summary is a tad misleading. The sexual violence that Andy experiences isn’t mentioned, nor is the constant threat of violence from men who perceive themselves as better. There’s no mention of the hope that comes when Andy learns of evidence that could clear his name, nor the indescribable pain that comes from having it ripped away from supposedly God-fearing men. Then again, we should know not to put our faith or trust in such a place or the people in it when we watch Red get rejected for parole at least twice during the course of the film. We should, I know, not side with criminals who are actually guilty of their crimes, but Darabont had a way of taking that short story and making it both timeless and profound, encouraging audiences to consider that humanity doesn’t stop just because someone broke the laws of man. In fact, in many ways, punishment without attempts for rehabilitation are nothing more than a failure of justice in the truest sense. It certainly helps that, as we meet them, Red and company are a mostly kind and supportive bunch. They hurt very few and find a kinship with Andy that, perhaps, had been unnoticeably vacant to them before Andy’s arrival. It’s not that they weren’t human before, it’s that Andy never seemed to let the prison overcome him psychologically and that carried over to others. Through Andy, Shawshank began to feel like a place that wasn’t so much home, but wasn’t hell either. At least, not for a while thanks to a few sips of cold brew, a few months of easy work during tax time, and even a bit of leniency from the guards. The issue of prison reform is a complicated one, but it seems, and perhaps this is an oversimplification, that if we start treating people like people, in prison or out, that there’s a greater chance of finding true freedom: a life where stresses are few, a life of your own making.\\nCenter: William Sadler as inHeywood in THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. (Image not representative of the 4K remaster.)\\nBecause the copy Warner Bros. Home Entertainment sent is the physical edition, I made a point to put on the included Blu-ray after watching the 4K UHD disc. Though there is no remastered sound, the HDR inclusion makes the picture almost indistinguishable from what you’ve seen before. HDR, or High Dynamic Range, enables the picture to present in a more natural way as there is greater contrast and balance available to play with. It’s immediately noticeable when you compare two opening scenes on the 4K UHD disc to the Blu-ray: Andy’s day in court and Red’s first parole hearing. On the 4K UHD edition, in the flashback, Andy’s walk in the darkness is exactly that, where we can see Andy but he’s more shrouded by the night, aiding in the sense that he’s stalking his wife and her lover. On the Blu-ray, it’s far brighter, so that while we know it’s nighttime, there’s less of a feeling of threat as we can see Andy moving as plain as day. Similarly, when Red leaves his parole hearing and is walking around the prison grounds, the sky is a gorgeous pinkish-blue, indistinguishable from either early morning or late evening, but beautiful nonetheless. On the Blu-ray, the scene is blown out to the point that the sky is basically white. Later, upon Andy’s arrival, the ensuring collection of scenes showing his delousing, meeting with Hadley, and going to his cell, the difference between visual tones is incredible. With HDR, there’s an ominous feeling as there’s little light in each of the spaces we see, making it feel like the guards are putting their new prisoners in some place secret, tucked away where the rights of the people could be violated without interruption. Same with the walk into the cells; the scene is darker, the whole area a mix of shadows and light, but minimal as the only sources are the few lamps placed around the walking structure. On the Blu-ray, the scenes are so bright that there’s no terror or disquiet, only a somber feeling of inevitability. It’s certainly not ideal, but the feeling conveyed in the 4K HDR edition truly feels like the start of a nightmare compared to where the film ends. Granted, the HDR does have its downsides, like making the scene where Andy and company put tar on the roof not looking quite as oppressive in the heat, but it’s hard not to bask in the beauty of the surrounding green in contrast to their tar and metal surroundings or to delight in the beauty of the sky as they drink their beer when the jobs complete. There have been few HDR restorations which have made a purchase (or repurchase) worthy, but this one absolutely does it. Frankly, compared to the HDR edition, the Blu-ray looks, well, like something you’d see on TNT rather than a theater.\\nFYI: though the film is currently available on digital, the 4K UHD edition isn’t available until the release date, so I cannot speak on the streaming edition.\\nL: Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd “Red” Redding in THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. (image not representative of 4K remaster.)\\nIn most cases, it’s the relationship to the title that determines whether someone is going to pick up a remaster, restoration, anniversary edition, or what have you. Given how strongly people feel about Shawshank, the decision was likely made as to whether this was a Day One pick-up or not upon the announcement. With luck, given the above comparison, anyone concerned about how it looks can feel better knowing that it’s not just a release for the sake of release. There’s actually something here that inspires such a shift in tone as to change how we emotionally react to the scenes we know so well. It doesn’t matter how we think we remember the moments, how they look now, in this edition, will force a shift in memory that we’ll most likely be grateful for.\\nThe Shawshank Redemption 4K UHD Previously Available Special Features:\\nCommentary by Frank Darabont\\n“Hope Springs Eternal: A Look Back at The Shawshank Redemption”\\n“Shawshank: The Redeeming Feature”\\n“The SharkTank Redemption”\\n5xStills Galleries\\n“Bogs Takes a Fall” Storyboards\\n“New Fish Arrive” Storyboards\\nAvailable on 4K UHD Blu-ray and digital September 14th, 2021.\\nFor more information on The Shawshank Redemption, head to the Warner Bros.

Hope can set you free.\\nOne writer on IMDB made the comment that the best movies \"touch the soul.\" Shawshank Redemption achieves greatness, indeed perfection, not because of special effects or action or violence or any semblance of distraction. It achieves greatness because it touches the soul with a straightforward cinematic experience filled with brilliant dialogue, exemplary performances and a message of hope in the midst of the darkest of times. It is a message that resonates deeply and grows more intense with each subsequent viewing of the film.\\n\\nThe first time I viewed Shawshank Redemption I didn\\'t find it to be anything special. Sure, stars Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were good BUT their performances weren\\'t anything special...or so I thought at the time.\\n\\nFrank Darabont directs Shawshank Redemption with a gentle, guiding hand allowing the actors to discover the essence within their characters. Some actors, undoubtedly, would not be up to the task. Robbins and Freeman, however, are not \"some actors.\" They are consummate actors and masterful in their portrayals here.\\n\\nBased upon Stephen King\\'s novella, Darabont creates a film that never buys into the drama of its story, instead choosing to present the lives of the characters involved without histrionics. I have long felt, in fact, that the film may even improve upon the novella by bringing it into focus and providing it with a pacing that allows a more explicit character development.\\n\\nI have noticed that many of my favorite films are ensemble pieces, and while Robbins and Freeman shine here it is actually the entire cast that brings this story to life with such grace and beauty. Supporting performances by the likes of James Whitmore, William Sadler, Gil Bellows and others who take what could be caricatures and give them in-depth personalities and thoughts and feelings.\\n\\nThomas Newman\\'s score is supremely divine and changes along with the characters. It further enhances Darabont\\'s pacing, as well. There are so many memorable scenes in Shawshank Redemption, however, the closing scene is certainly among one of the best closing scenes ever witnessed.\\n\\nIt is hard to fathom that a \"prison\" movie could be a source of tremendous hope, light and inspiration. Yet, to call Shawshank Redemption a prison movie is to minimize its greatness. It is a brilliant film, a study of humanity in all its wonder AND it happens to take place within the confines of a prison.\\n\\nMoving, brilliant, inspirational, hopeful and empowering are all words that describe \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" With outstanding performances from its ensemble cast and a work of tremendous cinematic poetry by director Frank Darabont. \"Shawshank Redemption\" creates a stellar vision that teaches, challenges, inspires and evokes a wide array of emotions and thoughts that serves to remind us that in the darkest moments of our lives there is always a light that shines within.\\n\\n© Written by Richard Propes\\nThe Independent Critic\\nFilm Submission Guidelines\\nAffiliate Disclosure\\n '},\n",

(Number two is The Godfather). Unlike the unholy tablets that are the box office charts, which are strongly linked to marketing budgets and show a preference for regurgitated storylines, and unlike the Oscars, which reflect the preferences of an exclusive coterie of largely like-minded insiders at a single moment in time, the IMDb survey provides an excellent, constantly updated, democratic overview of which movies endure in the popular imagination over time. Shawshank has motivated more than two million people to log their ratings. And the taste underlying the IMDb list is surprisingly good. Lots of films that have had little or no marketing budgets lately (such as number five, 12 Angry Men, from 1957) are on it.\\nTOP STORIES\\nMarxist Dreams from Kamala Harris’s Father\\nWILL SWAIM\\nNRPLUS\\nAre Young Republicans Allowed to Be Radiologists?\\nIAN KINGSBURY\\nNRPLUS\\nOlympic Boxer at Center of Gender Controversy Clinches Medal\\nZACH KESSEL\\nMasterfully written and directed by Frank Darabont, Shawshank well deserves its adoration. (Spoilers follow; the film is streaming on Netflix until April 30.) A quarter of a century after its release, it still does not seem cornball or dated. It might be the most emotionally fulfilling cinematic attempt to plumb two of the most crucial elements of our humanity. One is our longing to persevere, or even triumph, against the ravages of adversity — especially unjustified adversity. The other, related, is the  conviction, especially among Christians, that we must face up to our moral errors and pay the price for them. We suffer for our sins, but as long as we own them, we can expect a magnificent reward. Andy (Tim Robbins) earns his redemption when he admits that though he didn’t shoot his wife and her lover, he drove her away from him. \\nShawshank is neither a blockbuster nor a critics’ picture. Critics get most excited about hidden meanings and ambiguities that lend themselves to contemplation over repeated viewings, and also love films that massage certain sociopolitical anxieties. Shawshank is of no political persuasion; despite one of its two principal characters being black, it doesn’t even bother to inform us that it knows racism is bad. (Nor is the n-word ever used.) It doesn’t have onion layers of significance. It doesn’t need to be “unpacked.” As in Golden Age of Hollywood offerings like Gone with the Wind or Casablanca, what you see is pretty much what you get, though Shawshank’s Wikipedia page quotes at length from a hilarious “deep read” by a critic who positions the film’s hero as Christ and a group scene on a roof as an allusion to the Last Supper. No. Christ famously did not avenge himself against his tormentors and even more famously saved everyone but himself.\\nShawshank’s characters openly state what the movie is about. Unlike The Godfather, which may strike one viewer as a satire about the birth of modern corporate capitalism, another about the importance of family unity, and still another as an exciting gangster picture, Shawshank presents its themes with unmistakable clarity. The only element that particularly lends itself to allegorical thinking is Andy’s long crawl through the sewer, which is a kind of birth canal and rectum, leading to his rebirth (or excretion from the prison’s bowels) and capped by one of the most transcendent moments ever filmed, his cleansing in the rain as captured in a majestic rising crane shot by the great cinematographer Roger Deakins. It’s the only really attention-grabbing shot in the entire movie, and that discipline maximizes its potency, attaches ecstasy to deliverance.\\nThere is dualism, or symmetry, all over Shawshank, but this is just another way of saying the film is beautifully balanced, respectful of classic storytelling conventions. Andy stands for the quest for a better existence; his fellow inmate, Red (Morgan Freeman), counsels resigned acceptance of one’s fate. Two men in the film know the Bible by heart. One is the hypocritical, evil warden Norton (Bob Gunton), who blasphemously places himself in God’s position; the other, Andy, has absorbed its lessons. The film is both Christian and secular; despite its redemption theme, Andy’s guiding principle comes not from the Bible but from Bob Dylan: “Get busy living or get busy dying,” he says, distilling his and Red’s differing approaches to life. (Dylan’s line is “he not busy being born is busy dying.”) Depending on your degree of faith, Andy finds his way to heaven after doing penance for his sins or is simply able to retire to the beach after a lifetime of hard work in the financial services industry.\\nMore from\\nKYLE SMITH\\nStanley Kubrick’s Most Influential Movie\\n‘Goodnight, Geniuses’\\nHang in There, Joe Biden!\\nIn effect, the film is both an indie and a Hollywood tale — as gritty and downbeat as a Seventies drama and yet building to a happy ending as exhilarating as in any Fifties or Eighties film. Darabont’s misdirection is a marvel. For its first two hours, it’s a slice of life and a character study with no particular narrative direction. Andy bobs up and down on the waves of the warden’s caprice, sometimes living relatively well and sometimes thrown in the hole. Things happen, people come and go from Shawshank and Andy and Red seem certain to die there. But in his magnificent third act Darabont doesn’t just pull off that breathtaking twist, he reveals that this is an entirely different kind of picture from what we thought we were watching. Many of the elements that appeared to have no particular narrative purpose, plus a few we didn’t know about, turn out to be pieces of Andy’s ingeniously engineered prison break. Other prison-break pictures announce themselves at the get-go and generate suspense; this one doesn’t hint at the escape until it’s already complete. Shawshank would still be a superb film even if it had ended after an hour and 45 minutes, in Seventies style, with Andy (Al Pacino or Jack Nicholson) dying behind bars. The third act puts it on a different plane, with wickedness punished and virtue rewarded. It’s as if a funeral for a beloved man turns into a party when the man crawls out of his own grave.\\nAnother dualism: The film is told from both Andy’s point of view and Red’s. Red is the narrator, but almost everything he says is about Andy’s experience or things Andy told him. Very little of what Red says is about himself, even though Red is the one telling us the story. This is another element that would likely be altered if the film were made today: everyone who read the script would ask, “Why is the black guy placing himself in the background of a white guy’s journey?” There would be a quaking fear of think pieces declaring the film endorses white supremacy.\\nOvershadowed in the year of its release by two other landmarks, Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction, each of which is also ranked among the top dozen films of all time in the IMDb survey, Shawshank was a tough sell upon its wide release in October of 1994 and flopped, earning only $16 million on its first theatrical run. Audiences puzzled over that odd name, weren’t sure what genre it was, or maybe just didn’t want to be stuck in lockup for an evening. Though it was nominated for seven Oscars, it didn’t win any. It didn’t get a Golden Globe nomination for best picture. It didn’t win a single major award. And then, after many years, it emerged as the most beloved movie of all time.

What better way to give yourself some perspective than watching a movie (and a really good movie at that) about some people who have it a lot worse—because they’re in a real prison, where they have not only lost their liberty, but are also subject to the sadistic whims of those who rule over their lives?\\nIf that sounds like a good idea, I recommend Frank Darabont’s 1994 film The Shawshank Redemption, starring Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, and Bob Gunton. The screenplay, also by Darabont, is based on Stephen King’s short story “Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption”; the story itself is quite good, and offers proof, should anyone still need it, that King really can write.\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is narrated by “Red” Redding (Freeman), a longtime convict who has adjusted to life within prison walls and is that rarest of rarities, a prisoner who admits his guilt. By way of contrast, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker recently arrived at the prison following his conviction for murdering his wife and her lover, steadfastly maintains his innocence.\\nAndy’s bigger problem, however, is that he doesn’t know how to protect himself, resulting in his frequent victimization by “the sisters,” a brutal gang of rapists. In fact, Andy might not have survived, had not his accounting expertise allowed him to do favors for several of the guards. Eventually, his talents draw the attention of the remarkably corrupt Warden Norton (Gunton), and he becomes Norton’s unofficial partner in creating all sorts of illegal schemes to profit off the labor of the prisoners. Such expertise proves a dual-edged sword, however—while Andy enjoys the warden’s protection as long as he’s useful, this set-up also means the warden has a vested interest in keeping him a prisoner.\\nRed and Andy become friends, due in part to Red’s position as the guy who can get what you want—for a price. Two items he procures for Andy prove key to the plot: a poster of Rita Hayworth for his cell wall, and a rock hammer so he can make chess pieces out of rocks he finds in the prison yard. I’m not going to say more than that about what happens, but I will say that the story comes to one hell of a conclusion, with the last 30 minutes as powerful an example of the cinematic art, Hollywood style, as you are likely to come across. And the final scene? I’m not crying, you’re crying.\\nThere’s nothing supernatural in The Shawshank Redemption, but there are monsters all the same. Chief among them is Warden Norton, a class A hypocrite who likes to hide behind Bible quotations. Captain Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) is Norton’s chief enforcer, breaking bones and literally committing murder when ordered to do so. Bogs (Mark Rolston) leads “the sisters,” who specialize in preying on the weakest and most isolated of the inmates. But not everyone in this prison is evil: James Whitmore contributes a sensitive portrayal of Brooks Halen, an elderly prisoner who runs the library, and Gil Bellows plays Tommy Williams, a young prisoner with a good heart but few brains and even less luck.\\nThe Shawshank Redemption seems like an obvious classic today, but it didn’t even make back its budget when released in 1994, which demonstrates the imperfect correlation between ticket sales and cinematic quality. It did somewhat better with the Academy, being nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor (Freeman), and Best Cinematography (Roger Deakins), but won none of them. | Sarah Boslaugh\\nFind out where to stream The Shawshank Redemption at ReelGood.com.\\n    SHARE THIS:\\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\\nRELATED\\nThe Kiss Before the Mirror (Kino Lorber, NR)\\nFebruary 2, 2021\\nIn \"alexandra heller-nicholas\"\\nTop 10 Most-Read Articles of 2020\\nJanuary 2, 2021\\nIn \"best of 2020\"\\nHitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard (Lionsgate, R)\\nJune 16, 2021\\nIn \"antonio banderas\"\\nTAGS: BOB GUNTON CLANCY BROWN FEATURED FRANK DARABONT HOME VIEWING JAMES WHITMORE MORGAN FREEMAN PRISON ROGER DEAKINS SOCIAL DISTANCING CINEMA STEPHEN KING THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION TIM ROBBINS\\nPublished by Sarah Boslaugh\\nVIEW ALL POSTS BY SARAH BOSLAUGH\\nLeave a Reply\\nYour email address will not be published.

Maybe even the best of things. And good things never die.”\\nIt’s a piece of wisdom dished out by prisoner Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) to fellow inmate Ellis “Red” Redding (Morgan Freeman) during the course of the 1994 film “The Shawshank Redemption,” and while it’s a neat summation of the film’s central thesis, it could also just as easily serve as a description of the film’s fate following its release.\\nYou see, “Shawshank” is the Stephen King adaptation with the famously unwieldy title that famously flopped upon its initial release before famously becoming the revered classic it is today. And with the prison epic marking its 25th anniversary in September, it’s worth taking a look back at the saga of Andy Dufresne — the one truly innocent man in Shawshank Prison.\\nThe story’s premise is simple enough: Dufresne is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover in 1947 and sentenced to consecutive life sentences in the hellish Shawshank facility. There, he makes the acquaintance of Red. (Andy: “I understand you’re a man who knows how to get things.” Red: “I’m known to locate certain things from time to time.” This is the prison-movie version of a “meet cute.”)\\nWhat follows is cinematic alchemy of a kind that’s all too rare, propelled by a supremely talented cast, a sumptuous score by Thomas Newman and a first-rate script and direction from first-timer Frank Darabont, who had the not-insurmountable task of taking King’s skinny novella “Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption” (Darabont purchased the rights for the King-ly sum of $1) and expanding it to a nearly 2½-hour canvas.\\nWhile Rob Reiner, who found considerable success helming prior King adaptations “Stand by Me” and “Misery,” had hoped to direct (try to picture Reiner’s choice of Tom Cruise in the Dufresne role), it was Darabont’s vision — with its poignant insights into the nature of institutionalization and imprisonment — that ultimately won out.\\nIn fact, one of the most memorable scenes in the film originated entirely with Darabont and comes when Dufresne, who has managed to ingratiate himself with the prison’s guards and warden enough to have a certain amount of freedom within its facilities, locks himself inside the warden’s office and plays a portion of Mozart’s opera “The Marriage of Figaro” over the PA system, listening with eyes closed and a look of pure bliss stretching across his face.\\nIn that instant, he’s free. The calm that descends over the prison lasts only for a brief moment, but it’s magnificently captured by Darabont’s sweeping camera as the inmates listen intently to music that many don’t even understand. And the significance of that moment is substantial. Even as Andy is thrown into solitary confinement, he has already proved prison isn’t so much concrete walls as it is a state of mind.\\nMorgan Freeman (left) and Tim Robbins appear in “The Shawshank Redemption,” a film that’s more popular now than when it was first released in 1994.\\nPhoto: Michael Weinstein / Castle Rock Entertainment 1994\\nThis act of protest marks Dufresne as a disrupter not unlike another iconic inmate, Jack Nicholson’s McMurphy in “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.” Unlike “Cuckoo’s Nest,” however, “Shawshank’s” beating heart is the friendship between Red and Andy, one of the greatest in movie history and a career high-water mark for both Robbins and Freeman. We get to see their bond form and thrive during two decades of story time in a way that feels especially meaningful by the time the credits roll.\\nThere’s also a clever bit of fast-footed storytelling legerdemain at play throughout “The Shawshank Redemption,” as we find ourselves so drawn in by the unfolding character drama and the byplay between the various prisoners that we forget we’re watching a prison movie that must — almost by definition — culminate in some kind of escape scheme. It’s a testament to Darabont’s construction that those moments lose none of their impact even after countless viewings.\\nUpon its initial release, “The Shawshank Redemption” failed to recoup even its $25 million budget, topping out domestically at a relatively piddly $16 million. But just as Andy drives home to Red, good things never die. And 25 years later, the film’s ill-fated theatrical release is a distant flicker of memory, while its insights into the human experience continue to find audiences ready to embrace it as one of the greatest movies of all time.\\nAs redemptions go, it’s a pretty good one.\\n“The Shawshank Redemption” can be watched on several streaming services, including Amazon Prime.\\nZaki Hasan\\nZaki Hasan is a Bay Area writer.\\nYour weekly guide to Bay Area arts & entertainment.\\nMore In Movies & TV\\n'Trap' review: Josh Hartnett goes big as the serial killer in M.

In prison, Dufresne befriends canny fellow inmate, Red (Morgan Freeman), and slowly insinuates himself with the guards and warden due to his legal and financial acumen. Despite his terrible situation, Dufresne retains a hope, that is borne out in a daring escape mission.\\nReview: Epically sentimental and bafflingly overrated, The Shawshank Redemption requires an incredible leniency and sweet tooth from its viewer, plus a willingness to ignore some glaringly obvious plot holes which threaten to tarnish the film’s carefully sugar-coated veneer.\\nI accept that suspension of disbelief is a pre-requisite for most Hollywood fantasies, but the problem with The Shawshank Redemption’s flooziness is that the film also asks for some investment in the harsh realities of its prison arena to buy the later Andy and Red push for freedom. *Huge spoiler alert* Quite why, when the guards are so busy tearing Andy’s cell to shreds on a regular basis, they’d overlook checking behind his huge film posters is one puzzling oversight, and also the passing of time in the narrative – so key to setting up the catharsis of Andy and Red’s late encounter with freedom – seems bogus. Andy spends the best part of 20 years in jail, and Red upwards of 40 years, yet the sheer physical and spiritual destruction this would wring on the two men is not apparent.\\nAdmittedly, the film does have a sepia-tinted, fable-like quality that is well realised, from Morgan Freeman’s wry, honey-toned voiceover, to the sweetly-lit sequences that reach their apex in Andy’s heroically shot dash for freedom one tempestuous night. Still, it’s in this ending to the film that director Frank Darabont’s ultimate failure and tacky sensibility is truly outed. Instead of leaving implicit how Andy has constructed his prison break and what it will mean for his buddy Red, we get played out an over-extended and odiously demonstrative sequence, showing how Andy actually escaped (surely we got the picture from the earlier ice-pick/film poster sequences). Then we have Red earning his release and following Andy’s path all the way to the Buxton oak tree where Andy has left a letter and bounty to him, then on to the actual Mexican beach where Andy is living out his life. There was no need for Darabont to hold the audience’s hand through all this exposition – it was evident from Andy and Red’s earlier prison exchanges. And rather than show Red reading the letter out and even going to the idyllic Mexican beach, Darabont should have finished on Red elegiacally walking to the Buxton oak tree, leaving the audience to fill in the remaining pieces.

I’m not a fan of Tim Robbins, but the performances by he and Freeman are two of the best ever. If you know part of being a moviegoer is the ability to suspend disbelief and immerse yourself in the story being created, then I truly don’t understand how you can be so hyper critical of a well acted, well written, and well directed film. I guess you don’t like The Green Mile either because it’s not a realistic prison movie, huh?\\nREPLY\\ntodd mcd PERMALINK\\nDecember 31, 2019 10:15 pm\\nThis “reviewer” needs a different hobby.\\nREPLY\\nPaulo PERMALINK\\nFebruary 21, 2020 12:22 am\\n😂😂😂 Mr. Navarro is hilarious.

I suspect this is a “Notice me!! I’m important!!” review written by Pat. Find a universally loved movie on RT and give it a rotten review so you stand out among the freshly ripe tomatoes and get clicks/traffic.\\nCurious people (like me) will then click on the original review to see how any sane person would pan this masterpiece of film making. Sadly and with sincere regret; I will say it worked (I clicked). Fool me once…\\nREPLY\\nfrank PERMALINK\\nJuly 26, 2020 12:32 am\\nYou’re exactly right Steve. This is a review equivalent of someone having a sex tape leaked just to get everyone to look at you. Then his big criticism is that the denouement is played out in full detail. Some of us enjoy seeing the happy ending played out because that’s part of the enjoyment of watching the movie. Others want to signal their sophistication and wonderful perception by being bored with seeing the final act played out.\\nI was exactly like you, curious to see how some one could have rated this rotten. I was expecting to find an old review that had some specific issue with it. When I saw the date I had a hunch where this was going. I should’ve taken his advice about not needing to see the expected play out and not clicked on the review.

And why would Andy pause to throw his arms heavenward after crawling out of the sewer? Not very smart, to lose minutes after a prison break, keep your head low and go man! . Or was that just meant as cheap symbolism, the freshness of the rain washing away all the shit of the twenty preceding years?\\nREPLY\\nMatthew Griffiths PERMALINK\\nFebruary 15, 2021 10:08 pm\\nThe only thing baffling is your extremely strange review of one of the best films of all time.\\nREPLY\\nKenneth Sanders PERMALINK\\nMay 2, 2021 5:30 am\\nThis is, by far, the worst movie review I have ever read.\\nREPLY\\nmikochrissmann99 PERMALINK\\nMay 7, 2021 6:40 pm\\nI completely disagree with your assessment here, it’s a truly amazing film. Sure, it’s not a totally realistic movie, but it doesn’t have to be fully accurate. That’s where you have to suspend your disbelief a little bit. If you want a more realistic film, watch a documentary. As a critic, you’re supposed to put away your biases as much as possible and judge the movie on its merits of filmmaking. The reasons why many people including myself would call it a great movie is because it’s very well-acted, well-written, and well-directed. It’s an excellent film in my book, and possibly one of the best movies I ever seen.\\nREPLY\\nSomeone Who Appreciates A Good Movie PERMALINK\\nJune 11, 2021 1:39 pm\\nDude fuck you.\\nREPLY\\nHart PERMALINK\\nAugust 18, 2021 5:56 pm\\nJust gonna echo what everyone else is saying and point out that you’re a blatantly obvious contrarian and a moron.

RT really needs to vet whom they actually consider to be a “critic”. It’s painfully obvious in the last couple sentences that this guy wants to be a filmmaker but never actually amounted to anything, so instead he’s going to try and tear down other filmmakers that actually followed their dreams. Mr. Nabarro, if you read this, delete this shitty website and go make some films. I’d love to see how your expertise translates on screen.\\nREPLY\\nGreg PERMALINK\\nOctober 14, 2021 11:52 pm\\nBefore I opened the review for The Shawshank Redemption, I knew that Patrick PJ Nabarro is a robot, instead of a human being. Look at his review about Changeling. Maybe Patrick Nabarro is a 15-year-old high school student who needs to get his priorities straight. I really didn’t think that Ford vs. Ferrari is anything good. But most film critics gave that a positive review. I accept that, and I don’t go about writing that Ford vs. Ferrari is turkey.\\nREPLY\\nSteven PERMALINK\\nJuly 16, 2022 1:22 pm\\nTruly impossible to not legitimately laugh out loud at this complete whiff of a review. Though it’s not surprising- go look at this “professional” critic’s reviews. He’s incapable of giving any movie 5/5 (all time classics routinely get 3/5) because he believes it’s his job to point out errors, not celebrate excellent filmmaking. I’d bet his least favorite character of all time is the food critic from Ratatouille. Congratulations on being a blissfully, almost willfully ignorant contrarian. I cannot fathom going to the movies hoping for a poor experience.\\nREPLY\\nLeave a comment\\nARCHIVES\\n   \\n   Select Month\\n     February 2024\\n  March 2022\\n  February 2022\\n  December 2021\\n  November 2021\\n  October 2021\\n  July 2021\\n  February 2021\\n  January 2021\\n  December 2020\\n  October 2020\\n  August 2020\\n  July 2020\\n  June 2020\\n  May 2020\\n  April 2020\\n  March 2020\\n  February 2020\\n  January 2020\\n  December 2019\\n  November 2019\\n  October 2019\\n  September 2019\\n  August 2019\\n  July 2019\\n  May 2019\\n  March 2019\\n  February 2019\\n  January 2019\\n  December 2018\\n  November 2018\\n  October 2018\\n  September 2018\\n  August 2018\\n  July 2018\\n  June 2018\\n  May 2018\\n  April 2018\\n  March 2018\\n  February 2018\\n  January 2018\\n  December 2017\\n  November 2017\\n  October 2017\\n  September 2017\\n  August 2017\\n  July 2017\\n  June 2017\\n  May 2017\\n  April 2017\\n  March 2017\\n  February 2017\\n  January 2017\\n  December 2016\\n  November 2016\\n  October 2016\\n  September 2016\\n  August 2016\\n  July 2016\\n  June 2016\\n  May 2016\\n  April 2016\\n  March 2016\\n  February 2016\\n  January 2016\\n  December 2015\\n  November 2015\\n  October 2015\\n  September 2015\\n  August 2015\\n  July 2015\\n  June 2015\\n  May 2015\\n  March 2015\\n  January 2015\\n  December 2014\\n  November 2014\\n  October 2014\\n  September 2014\\n  August 2014\\n  July 2014\\n  June 2014\\n  May 2014\\n  April 2014\\n  March 2014\\n  February 2014\\n  January 2014\\n  December 2013\\n  November 2013\\n  October 2013\\n  September 2013\\n  August 2013\\n  July 2013\\n  June 2013\\n  May 2013\\n  April 2013\\n  March 2013\\n  February 2013\\n  January 2013\\n  December 2012\\n  November 2012\\n  October 2012\\n  July 2012\\n  June 2012\\n  May 2012\\n  April 2012\\n  March 2012\\n  February 2012\\n  January 2012\\n  December 2011\\n  November 2011\\n  October 2011\\n  September 2011\\n  August 2011\\n  June 2011\\n  May 2011\\n  April 2011\\n  March 2011\\n  February 2011\\n  January 2011\\n  December 2010\\n  November 2010\\n  October 2010\\n  September 2010\\n  August 2010\\n   CATEGORIES\\nAfrican Cinema\\nAnimation\\nArticles\\nAsian & Australasian Cinema\\nBritish Cinema\\nDocumentaries\\nEuropean Cinema\\nLatin American & Caribbean Cinema\\nPublications\\nRecent Releases\\nSilent Cinema\\nUncategorized\\nUS & Canadian Cinema\\nPATRICK’S TWEETS\\nTweets by pjnabarro\\nBlog at WordPress.com.'},\n",

NEWELL\\nIN , , , , , , ,\\nThe Shawshank Redemption. 1994. Directed & Written by Frank Darabont; based on the novella “Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption” by Stephen King from his collection Different Seasons.\\nStarring Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, James Whitmore, Brian Libby, & Mark Rolston.\\nCastle Rock Entertainment.\\nRated 14A. 142 minutes.\\nCrime/Drama\\n★★★★★\\nWe all know that The Shawshank Redemption is pretty much the most well regarded adaptation of Stephen King’s writing. There are some other great ones. As a horror fanatic, I do love Pet Sematary and The Mist, Carrie, among many more. But the greatness of King’s writing doesn’t always come through, even in some of the decently made films. Certainly not in the real abortions that have crawled onscreen like The Mangler (botched an awesome story of modern witchcraft for cheap and flashy horror) or the middle of the road adaptations such as Apt Pupil that are creepy enough but sanitise King to a degree where his original themes are nowhere near as strong.\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is up there with the best of King adapted to film. If not right at the very top of the heap. Perhaps because it has everything you’d expect from one of his stories: good characters, interesting dialogue, and the darkness for which he’s known so well. Too many people consider him a strict ‘horror author’ but that’s only if they’ve never dug into his catalogue. Yes, he writes a lot of creepy stuff, plenty of horrific stories from novels down to the short stuff. Yet above all else he is a storyteller. He specialises, no matter the genre where you stick him, in getting the reader involved, drawing us in to a place of familiarity where we understand and know his characters before they’re plunged into some unpredictable, tense situation. You can put those characters in a jail, in a post-apocalyptic landscape, a far off fantastical version of the United States of America, or stuck in a car. With King, it’s always going to be interesting. And it just so happens Frank Darabont is the most capable director who’s proven themselves up the point of this writing in regards to adapting these tales for the screen. This is one of the most revered films for a reason. It isn’t just because liking it is popular, or something foolish. The Shawshank Redemption is a top notch work of cinema. One of the best out of the 1990s, and a towering force of dramatic power amongst films of its kind.\\nPart of why I’ve always so hugely admired Darabont’s work on this picture is that he took an excellent novella and adapted it brilliantly. The storytelling in the Different Seasons section labelled Hope Springs Eternal – “Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption” – is expert stuff from King. He’s one of my favourite writers because of his ability to really get us into the rhythm of his characters. The novella starts us right out in the perspective of Red (played in the film by Mr. Morgan Freeman a.k.a The God Damn Man). Instead of doing that immediately in the screenplay Darabont opts to give us a little preview of Andy Dufresne (the equally amazing Tim Robbins), as we see him the night of the crime he says he didn’t commit, a brief scene in court. Then we start into Red’s point of view. What I like about that is we’re given Andy’s perspective outside the walls before encroaching on prison territory, where Red is the man to follow. This opening sort of mirrors the entrance into jail that we experience alongside Andy, taking us from one side of the gate to the other. Almost chilling, in a way.\\nMoreover, Darabont generally sticks to the staples of the novella. Something I dig about short stories and novellas is that often their natural length is pretty conducive to adaptation onto film. With big novels that are between 300-500 pages, or more, you run the risk of omitting too much, omitting the wrong bits and pieces, which generally becomes a figurative minefield for a screenwriter. That’s why, far as I’m concerned, so much of King’s great works end up as utter shite on film. “Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption” is a 96-page novella, and if you work off the 1 page = 1 minute rule (not always applicable but just for general purposes) that comes out to just over an hour and a half. It’s feasable to see how Darabont was able to stretch that out a little bit extra to include particular sequences, visuals, so on. Whereas if you take a massive King book, some of the 800-1,000 epics, to try making a single film out of ALL THAT is far too ambitious. Maybe it’s why I trust Darabont most out of anybody else to adapt these awesome stories. He knows how to navigate the writing.\\nThe strength of the relationship between Andy and Red is what sells the original story, so it’s no surprise the same goes for Darabont’s film. Even in the way Red talks about Andy, narrating the novella, you can feel the relationship in his tone. Only gets better for the fact Morgan Freeman plays the role. He has that great voice, and more than that he’s such a thoughtful, intelligent actor. He has a ton of range while still always giving us that star quality for which he’s known. His performance makes Red incredibly vivid. By the time the finale rolls round you feel as if you’ve spent all those years with him in prison. Of course the same goes for Tim Robbins in one of his best performances, up there with The Player, Jacob’s Ladder and a few others. His version of Andy Dufresne is every bit as affable, calm and collected as King’s characterisation. Then there’s the stretch where everyone wonders if Andy is about to kill himself, right before his big escape attempt – Robbins pulls you into that despair Andy’s feeling, that cold, dead look in his eyes, as he thinks about Zihuatanejo in Mexico. A bunch of other scenes reflect that empty void in Andy after all those years. However, it’s this moment between him and Red where he actually feels hopeless, hearing his long-time friend admit to being institutionalised himself and feeling like “shitty pipe dreams” aren’t worth entertaining. That scene could have been plenty less intense and emotional. Having these two men, specifically Robbins, together acting their asses off pushes it forward to be the calm before the storm. This is the scene preceding the plot’s climax. Without the emotional depth and range of Robbins, as well as Freeman, the reveal of what happens next would never reach the heights it does. Even if you see the big finish coming, even if you’ve read the novella by King, the acting takes us to that special place where the unexpected grabs you and doesn’t let go. Let’s hope they never remake this one. I don’t hate remakes, though I can’t see any other pair doing these roles justice to make it anything better than what both Freeman and Robbins accomplished under Darabont’s direction.\\nLike a lot of other cinephiles, I’ve watched The Shawshank Redemption many, many times. Literally, it’s probably been close to 200 times since first seeing it a little over two decades ago. It was one of those VHS tapes I threw on when coming home from school, eating lunch and watching 20 minutes before heading back to class. I’d view it in bits and pieces, sometimes as a whole. There are scenes I could just turn on to watch then put it away again. Yes, I’m a die hard Stephen King fan. I have a ton of his books on my shelf, I’ve read most of what he’s published, including his short stories and non-fiction writing texts. So there’s that bias, I guess. But this is just a damn good slice of cinema. Everything from the acting to the production, the period look of the prison and other locations, it’s all done to perfection. Roger Deakins as director of photography, giving us that signature look of his filled with extraordinary techniques which help this prison film look better than most. Sometimes movies with voice-overs, particularly those with lots, can get boring. Like Scorsese, Darabont is able to keep us enthralled, and his adaptation of King’s work allows us to indulge in a ton of story without every feeling bogged down.\\nI could preach the good word forever. Just know, this is absolutely one of the greatest films. No. Doubt. Rag all you want on nostalgia, or whatever. This is a work of incredible mastery, from the top down.\\nRate this:\\n4 Dig it?\\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\\nClick to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\\nClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\\nClick to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\\nLoading...\\nRelated\\nCastle Rock – Season 1, Episode 5: “Harvest”\\nCastle Rock – Season 1, Episode 2: “Habeas Corpus”\\nPrisoners: Guzikowski & Villeneuve Subvert the Usual Thriller\\nPREVIOUS\\nRidley Scott’s Alien: Gorgeously Horrific Isolation\\nNEXT\\nOutcast – Season 1, Episode 8: “What Lurks Within”\\nJoin the Conversation\\nSupport Father Son Holy Gore\\nSearch\\nSEARCH\\nCREATE A WEBSITE OR BLOG AT WORDPRESS.COM'},\n",

There haven't been this many good films in any fall season in memory. One of them is the terribly titled ``The Shawshank Redemption,'' based on a novella by Stephen King (in one of his more compelling and less commercially horrific moods). Ostensibly, it is a prison film, complete with every cliche known to the genre - brutal guards; thuggish prisoners; a stern and unjust warden; and thoughtful, intelligent prisoners who maintain that they are innocent. It almost becomes laughable when a bird arrives - a suggestion of Burt Lancaster's ``Birdman of Alcatraz.''\\nSeemingly, we've seen all this before. The mythical quality of ``Cool Hand Luke'' is there. The persistent fight for survival of ``Papillon'' is there. The friendship between two prisoners from ``Kiss of the Spider Woman'' is there, although very different and more subtle.\\nWhat this film has is a compelling storytelling style that takes its own time and eventually ties all the threads together. It also has very commendable performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman and at least three very strong supporting performers, including a possible Oscar nomination for the veteran James Whitmore.\\nAll this serves to offset the excessive length. At almost 2 1/2 hours, the film is so long that it sometimes makes us feel as if we are serving hard time ourselves. The investment, though, turns out to be worth it. It's one of those films that seems better several days later than it did while you were sitting through it.\\nThe plot covers a 20-year-period from 1947 to 1967 and chronicles, among other things, an unlikely prison friendship. Robbins is helped by his baby face and calm exterior in suggesting the role of Andy Dufresne, a Portland, Maine, banker who is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He's sentenced to the maximum-security Shawshank Prison. He is a stoic, quiet man who is initially unpopular in prison. When he's attacked and repeatedly raped by a group of thugs who call themselves The Sisters, he somehow maintains his dignity.\\nHis demeanor is noticed by Red, a lifer who is the prison's black market expert, well played by Morgan Freeman. Red and Andy eventually become friends. Strangely, though, the friendship is not the focus of the film; there are several little films hiding within the larger screenplay. The episodic nature diverts your attention but can be tolerated if you get into the slow rhythm of it all.\\nOne of the subplots stars James Whitmore, the veteran who has been nominated twice for the Oscar for ``Battleground'' and ``Give `Em Hell, Harry.'' He plays the prison librarian, a man who is so well adjusted to prison that he falls apart when he is asked to adjust to the outside world. Whitmore is yet another of the competitors for this year's supporting actor Oscar.\\nRed proves his finesse by smuggling in a poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. It is replaced, as time goes by, by posters of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. As it eventually turns out, these girls are a convict's best friend.\\nAndy becomes the financial adviser and fixer, first for a brutal guard (Clancy Brown) and then for the hypocritical warden (Bob Gunton). Andy's financial wizardry makes the warden a wealthy man, who can't afford to let his bookkeeper ever get out on parole.\\n``Shawshank'' is occasionally too slow and occasionally too outwardly sentimental, but if you like old movies, you'll like this one. It has the novelty to use plot development rather than unnecessary shock treatments to move forward.\\nIts familiarity and unsubtle bent keep it from quite becoming a great film, or even one of the year's best films, but it is a very good and reliable film. Good storytelling and good acting make the time well served.

The Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins film eventually nabbed seven Oscar nominations. The Hollywood Reporter’s original review is below:\\nCastle Rock has tapped into the wellspring of yet another Stephen King novella, from the same collection as Stand by Me. While it seems unlikely that this well-wrought film about hope and friendship in a maximum security prison will do Stand by Me-level business, The Shawshank Redemption should appeal to a mature audience. The marketing challenge will be to lure a mainstream audience to this dark drama starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman with, to boot, an enigmatic title.\\nRelated Stories\\nMOVIES\\n'Saratoga': THR's 1937 Review\\nMOVIES\\n'The Towering Inferno': THR's 1974 Review\\nCovering a span of time from 1946 to 1967, Shawshank focuses on the plight of a Maine banker, Andy Dufresne (Robbins), sentenced to two life terms for the murder of his wife and lover. Laconic and a bit chilly, Andy is somewhat of an outcast among the uneducated, macho thugs who make up the main brunt of the prison population.\\nAdmittedly, he’s not an easy guy to get to know and only comes to enjoy a prison friendship when he makes a deal with the prison black-market supplier, Red (Freeman), to get him a tiny hammer for his rock collection. Red is also an enigma to most of the inmates. He keeps his nose clean and his hopes up even though the parole board routinely denies him pardon, obviously a racial antagonism.\\nWhile the story roils with some rousing prison-type action and is coarsened by an overpowering sense of frustration, The Shawshank Redemption is really about the unlikely friendship between Andy and Red: Each nurtures the other and serves as a touchstone for keeping their sanity intact.\\nFrank Darabont’s writing and direction are generally crisp, but Shawshank is a tough watch and audiences could use some time cut from its 142 minutes.\\nIn the lead roles, both Robbins and Freeman are outstanding, layering their performances with snippets of individuality: Their small, daily sustenances and minor triumphs are wonderfully inspiring.\\nTechnical contributions are well-crafted, particularly cinematographer Roger Deakins‘ forbidding lensing. Filmed in a garrison-like former prison in Mansfield, Ohio, Shawshank is often overwhelming in its depiction of the granite-cold, stony horror of prison life. Most splendid is Thomas Newman’s somber score, which, at its best moments, alights with radiant textures and sprightly grace notes, nicely emblematic of the film’s central theme. — Duane Byrge\\nREAD MORE ABOUT:\\nCLASSIC REVIEWS\\nTHR NEWSLETTERS\\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\\nSUBSCRIBE\\nSIGN UP\\nMORE FROM THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER\\nSPORTS\\n8 Times Snoop Dogg Proved Himself a National Treasure at the 2024 Olympics\\nOBITUARIES\\nJune Walker Rogers, Broadway Performer, Playwright and Author, Dies at 97\\nKAMALA HARRIS\\nTrump Backs Out of Harris Debate on ABC News, Agrees to One on Fox News\\nPARIS OLYMPICS\\nAlgerian Boxer Imane Khelif Breaks Down in Tears After Clinching Medal at Paris Olympics Following Gender Outcry\\nSIMONE BILES\\nSimone Biles Seemingly Takes Jab at Donald Trump After Paris Olympics Victory: “I Love My Black Job”\\nOBITUARIES\\nDaniel Selznick, ‘The Making of a Legend: Gone With the Wind’ and ‘Blood Feud’ Producer, Dies at 88\\nSHOPPING WITH THR\\nSuni Lee’s K-Beauty Pick Is a Glowy Summer Skin Staple\\nBY ERIN LASSNER\\nThe Best Designer Sales to Shop Before Labor Day: Nordstrom, Italist, Net-A-Porter, Farfetch\\nBY DANIELLE DIRECTO-MESTON\\nWhere to Buy Sold-Out Sabrina Carpenter ‘Short n’ Sweet’ Concert Tickets Online (Plus, How to Save Up to $300 on Seats)\\nBY DANIELLE DIRECTO-MESTON\\nArticle’s Designer-Favorite Outdoor Furniture Is on Sale Through Monday — Here’s What to Shop\\nBY ERIN LASSNER\\nTHR NEWSLETTERS\\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\\nEmail Address\\nSUBSCRIBE TODAY\\nSIGN UP\\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

Although I am writing my review in 2014 -- twenty years after the movie’s original release -- it seems as fresh and alive as ever. Top-notch performances by all cast members, exceptional cinematography by Roger Deakins, and masterful direction by Frank Darabont (who also penned the screenplay based on Stephen King’s short story “Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption”) combine to make the film something special indeed.\\nCo-stars Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins simply transform themselves into two unconventional prisoners. Their inspired acting helps us understand the virtue of patience and hope, regardless of how long and how much suffering one might face. Freeman plays “Red” Redding, a man who has adapted to prison life by becoming the institution’s “go to” guy for various items from the outside world. Robbins is Andy Dufresne, a successful banker sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and lover. These very different men become friends who think decency and kindness are important, even in the brutal prison environment.\\nThat brutality may be very hard for viewers to watch, but those disturbing scenes are necessary to give the film its gritty realism. Sadistic Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) runs Shawshank Prison like it’s his own personal kingdom, and Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown) carries out the warden’s orders -- very enthusiastically.\\nThings change for the better when Captain Hadley receives help with some paperwork from Andy. It’s not long until Andy is assisting all the guards with their tax returns. Soon Warden Norton takes interest in Andy and uses him for his own paperwork. The result? The warden grants little favors that improve the lives of the prisoners. Unfortunately, a new prisoner (Gil Bellows) arrives with a revelation about Andy’s case -- one that creates chaos for everyone concerned. The only thing Andy can do involves a daring escape. But how? And what will happen to Red if Andy leaves?                         \\nAlthough The Shawshank Redemption boasts a number of memorable scenes, my favorite shows Andy broadcasting an opera selection to the entire prison population. All the men are stunned as they listen in awe to the beautiful music. However, as you’ve probably heard, no good deed goes unpunished. Especially at Shawshank.      \\nReleased in 1994, this acclaimed motion picture earned seven well-deserved Academy Award nominations including a Best Actor nod for Morgan Freeman.

Those are the settings of these similar films, but they really are inspirational dramas of individuals struggling against overbearing authority. Tim Robbins, one of our best, most casual, young actors, plays a banker in the 1940s who is falsely sent to Shawshank Prison for the death of his wife and her lover. In this maximum security penitentiary, Robbins is harassed by the warden, beaten by guards, and sexually abused by inmates.\\nThe first and best friend he makes is the elder statesman of the yard, a longtime convict played by the great Morgan Freeman. Over time, Robbins will make other friends, some of whom will be absolutely paralyzed by freedom in the straight world. Even better than \"Birdman of Alcatraz,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption\" creates the world of overbearing closure that is prison. \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo\\'s Nest\" was set in confinement, too, and like that story, the narrative drive of \"The Shawshank Redemption\" on a story by the prolific Stephen King is a journey of freedom, physical and psychological. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" comes out of nowhere in the sense that it is a first feature film by Frank Darabont, who, with this one work, declares himself a special talent.\\nHe adapted King\\'s story for the screen and insisted on directing the story too, much in the same way that Sylvester Stallone could not be pried loose from \"Rocky.\" Guts equals glory. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is playing at the Water Tower and Old Orchard Theaters.

       "   'Critic': \"Subscribe\\nCINEMA: A Joint Enterprise\\nUpdating the prison genre in a deft, well-played tale of revenge\\nBy Richard Schickel Monday, Sept. 26, 1994\\nTweet\\nShare\\nRead Later\\nEmail Print Share\\nReprints\\nFollow @TIME\\nRevenge is a dish best served cold. And as coolers go, it's hard to think of anyplace more chilling than Shawshank, the fictional state reformatory to which Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sentenced to serve two consecutive life terms for murdering his wife and her lover.\\nIts architectural style is Victorian Gothic, its penology just plain gothic. Or maybe Visigothic. It is a place designed not to reform but to drive you crazy. Cool is what you need to survive here, and supercool is what you need to maintain a semblance of humanity. Andy, who insists he has been wrongly convicted, looks fragile. But he has a lot of tensile strength, as the joint's brutal homosexual ring ultimately finds out. He has even more mental strength, patiently working up -- for 19 years -- an escape attempt that will not only bring down the insufferably pious and hypocritical warden Norton (Bob Gunton, an oil slick in shoes) but also turn a tidy profit for him and his best friend, Red Redding (Morgan Freeman).\\nAndy was a banker on the outside, trained to take the long, interest-bearing view, and he's well played by Robbins, an actor who once made an agreeable specialty of nutsiness but is even better at bland scheming. He makes his way in prison society by doing tax work for the screws, ultimately making himself invaluable to the crooked warden and a source of solid ironic humor to the audience. Even so, his character could not survive without Red's example. Red is the guy who can get you anything, from a pack of butts to a movie-star poster. He's all self-containment, never raising his voice or anyone's suspicions about his activities. And Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing.\\nThe movie needs the kind of authenticity that Freeman brings to it. The Shawshank Redemption is based on a Stephen King novella that is just a little too smooth for its own good. It's satisfying to watch all the book's moving parts mesh, but a certain lifelike uncertainty is sacrificed to the neatness. Happily, writer-director Frank Darabont understands this. He makes you feel the maddening pace of prison time without letting his picture succumb to it. He is also efficient and clever with secondary characters like James Whitmore's con librarian, who's been in so long he can't survive on the outside.\\nThere may be something redemptive in this story -- a triumph of the tormented human spirit and all that -- but neither Darabont nor the actors overplay the point. They are content to update the old prison genre deftly and unpretentiously. It always did work when it was done well, and it still does; and if using Redemption in the title instead of the more accurate Revenge helps to bring in the upwardly mobile, who cares? James Cagney would have felt right at home in Shawshank.\\nDiscover\\nPlay War Thunder now for free\\nFight in over 2000 unique and authentic Vehicles. Fight on Land, on Water and in the Air.

Despite the film's modest performance at the box office on its first release, Frank Darabont made a major splash with his assured directorial debut.\\n\\nAdapted by the director himself from a Stephen King short story - one that appeared in the same 'Different Seasons' collection that spawned the films Stand By Me and Apt Pupil - the plot has Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a man arriving in prison in 1946 on a double life sentence for the murder of his wife and her lover. Andy is an apparently decent man with a preternaturally calm disposition, who is quietly insistent about his own innocence.\\n\\nHe befriends Red (Freeman), a veteran of the penal system, and their growing friendship over 20 years forms the backbone of the film - and provides a narrative pay-off as satisfying as it is heart-warming. Using a voiceover narration, much of which is taken verbatim from King's story, the film's great triumph is its sincerity, and even those moments that might have felt mawkish - the suicide of the old lag, for example, who fails to adjust to life on the outside - achieve the dignity of genuine tragedy.\\nAt nearly two and a half hours in length, it's a film with plenty of time on its hands yet, thanks to engagingly warm performances by Robbins and Freeman, it very rarely drags. Robbins in particular locates a deep-seated humanity in his enigmatic banker (who unexpectedly benefits from his accounting skills), while the issues that Darabont is concerned with - faith, friendship, patience and hope - are woven seamlessly into the fabric of the story.\\n\\nThe director returned to Stephen King for his belated follow-up, The Green Mile, which failed to live up to the promise of his debut, replacing its warmth and subtlety with sheer bulk. Here though Darabont achieves that rarest of goals and creates a film that not only stands up to repeated viewings but which, for its legion of dedicated fans, approaches the power and significance of on-screen therapy.\\nVERDICT\\nPowerful, poignant, thought-provoking and finally irresistibly uplifting. Thanks to quietly dignified performances and Darabont's own inventive direction, The Shawshank Redemption remains a first class example of how to approach potentially weighty issues with conviction, style, lightness and wit.\\nIMAGE GALLERY\\nIF YOU LIKE THIS FILM...\\nNIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3: DREAM WARRIORS, A\\nTHE MIST\\nTHE WEATHER MAN\\nFEATURES\\n50 FILMS TO SEE BEFORE YOU DIE\\nFILMS VS BOOKS\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nCREDITS\\nActor\\nGIL BELLOWS\\nTIM ROBBINS\\nMORGAN FREEMAN\\nWILLIAM SADLER\\nCLANCY BROWN\\nBOB GUNTON\\nDirector\\nFRANK DARABONT\\nProducer\\nNIKI MARVIN\\nPhotographer\\nROGER DEAKINS\\nComposer\\nTHOMAS NEWMAN\\nScreen Writer\\nFRANK DARABONT\\nWriter (Story)\\nSTEPHEN KING\\nSHARE THIS\\nTWEET THIS\\nPOST TO FACEBOOK\\nCHANNEL4\\nMORE4\\nE4\\n4MUSIC\\nAbout FILM4\\nAdvertising on FILM4\\nHelp\\nPrivacy\\nAccessibility\\nTerms and Conditions\"},\n",

It's not a horror film, rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twisteroo of twists since The Crying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting off his goofball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion) is shipped to the gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank State Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a beautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to 1967.\\nDufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the hellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of beatings, rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire his fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red (Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given time, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to himself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in poster form.\\nThe mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wiseguy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams, giving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest miracle.\\nIf you're miserable enough to look for gripes then, yes, it does drift on too long and who needs prison buggery again? Yet the ending has such poetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it flopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of Oscardom.

It’s based on Stephen King’s novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.\\nAndy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a mild-mannered straight-arrow Maine banker, who in 1946 is wrongly given two concurrent life sentences for the double-murder of his wife and her lover. The geeky laconic banker is despised at first by the other inmates at Shawshank State Prison for being so different, but when he proves he’s not a rat after a number of beatings and seems to have some spine–the men begin to alter their initial opinions. Slowly Andy forges a friendship with fellow lifer Red (Morgan Freeman), the convict fixer, who smuggles into the prison a rock-hammer Andy requests for his rock collecting hobby.\\nIn 1949 while tarring the roof of a prison building, Andy overhears the brutal head guard, Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), complain about inheriting $35,000 and is afraid the tax man will take a big chunk of it. Andy shows him a legal way of getting the inheritance to be tax free and only asks for beer for the men on the work detail. This earns Andy the friendship of the veteran cons and the protection by the head guard from the ruffian cons trying to gang rape Andy. Andy’s bookkeeping ability is then exploited by the fascist Warden Norton (Bob Gunton), who gets kickbacks from private concerns to employ or not to employ his slave-labor prisoners and has opened up a secret account to stash away the bribe money.\\nSome twenty years in confinement has been a heart-wrenching experience for the tenacious life loving Andy, who somehow remains sane. But when he learns from a new young prisoner (Gil Bellows) who did the actual double-killing and the warden not only refuses to help but punishes him with solitary confinement–Andy puts his The Count of Monte Cristo plan into motion he had in mind ever since Red got him that small pick-axe.\\nThe freedom loving innocent man gets his revenge on the fascist bully screw and the sadistic corrupt warden, in a movie that veers between gritty toughness and unbearable sentimentality, in a pic that is saddled with strident dialogue and artificial prison scenes. When finally the air clears in this exhausting but laudable melodrama, it feels good when Morgan Freeman, the film’s narrator, tells us his good friend Andy “crawled out of a river of shit and came out clean.”\\nIt helps matters considerably in this somewhat hamstrung pic (the dialogue is stilted) that Robbins gives an endearing subdued performance and the always reliable Freeman gives a crowd-pleasing showy performance (at least that was good enough for me, as I was genuinely moved by how the white-collar Robbins character survived in such a brutal and alien environment).\\nREVIEWED ON 3/16/2011 GRADE: A-\\nDennis Schwartz: “Ozus’ World Movie Reviews”\\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ\\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE\\nTOGETHER\\nAugust 5, 2019\\nCAVALCADE\\nAugust 5, 2019\\nEATING RAOUL\\nAugust 5, 2019\\nSearch\\nSEARCH\\nHome\\nReviews\\nTop Ten Lists\\nContact\\nCopyright 2024 - Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews'},\n",

It\\'s 1949, and Andy doesn\\'t have the stuff for prison life. Andy befriends \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman) and uses his past as a banker to get a job in the prison library. But things unravel. In doing the books for the warden, he learns that the prison boss is taking bribes, and Andy is to launder them. A lovable former inmate hangs himself when he gets to the outside but can\\'t adjust after decades behind bars. The inmate whom Andy helps get his GED is shot by the guards to keep him quiet about information that might prove Andy is innocent of the murders and set him free. Andy spends two months in solitary. After he gets out, he seems depressed and Red worries he\\'ll kill himself. The next day, Andy isn\\'t dead, but he isn\\'t there, either -- he\\'s escaped. The rest is a perfect Stephen King happy ending, complete with comeuppance for the corrupt warden.\\nShow more\\nIs It Any Good?\\nOur review:\\nParents say (44 ):\\nKids say (172 ):\\nThis is a movie that stands the test of time and still resonates with viewers. Call this the Stand by Me of prison stories. Stephen King, who penned Stand by Me, also wrote the short story on which The Shawshank Redemption is based. Here we have all the things that made Stand by Me such a satisfying experience: loveable characters, writerly flourishes, one-dimensional evil antagonists, enduring friendships, poetic justice, and a happy ending. This one is far darker and far more violent than Stand by Me and so ought to be reserved only for older teens. The story is slow to develop, and younger kids and children sensitive to the suffering of others may find this world a difficult one to sit with for the film\\'s duration.\\nShow more\\nTalk to Your Kids About ...\\nFamilies can talk about the ways oppressed people have kept their spirit historically -- for example, through spirituals created by slaves.

He is befriended by Red (Morgan Freeman), a convict who knows the ropes and helps him to cope with the frightening realities of prison life.\\nReview by Louise Keller:\\nI love this film. It\\'s one of those films that deserves pride of place in any DVD library and warrants repeated viewing. Frank Darabond\\'s superb script (based on a Stephen King short story) is economical and involving and this, his directing debut, delivers a classic drama about two convicted criminals who forge an unforgettable friendship. It\\'s a story about hope and dreams and one whose emotional impact is as great as the Pacific Ocean is blue.\\n\\nIn the first few scenes, we are given a snapshot of the dire situation in which Tim Robbins\\' bank Vice President Andy finds himself, when he is convicted of murdering his adulterous wife and her golf-pro lover. We also meet Morgan Freeman\\'s Red, a convicted murderer who has been incarcerated for the past 20 years. Red is a man who can get things (cigarettes, reefer, brandy or pretty much anything anyone wants) and has no illusions about his regularly rejected parole applications (\\'same old shit; different date\\'). He is resigned to the never-ending, unbending, cruel prison life under Bob Gunton\\'s bible-loving, callous Warden Norton. The story begins in 1947 but spans many years as Andy finds a niche within the prison walls, making himself useful to the Warden and guards by providing \\'sound financial planning\\' (channelling, filtering and laundering their ill-gotten gains).\\n\\nFreeman\\'s narrative holds the story together and like a skilled conductor, waves a baton to orchestrate our emotions. Red is the only crim who admits to his crime. \\'Everyone else is innocent,\\' they declare with a smile. Baby-faced Robbins is excellent as the softly spoken newcomer with a love for geology and books and who asks for a rock hammer and a poster of Rita Hayworth. There are many memorable scenes like the one when Andy puts Italian opera onto the turntable and lets the music play all through the prison. It was like some beautiful bird, muses Red. Every last man felt free. Even his punishment in the hole does not dampen his spirits. After all, he had Mozart to keep him company - in his heart and in his head. There\\'s another key scene as Andy and Red sit in the prison yard by a stone wall and dream about a place in Mexico by the Pacific Ocean which has no memory. Full of heart and guaranteed to stick in your memory forever, this is a treasure of a film that everyone should see.\\n\\nThe two-disc DVD release includes an audio commentary, storyboards, still gallery, Charlie Rose Show with Frank Darabond and Morgan Freeman, plus a handful of featurettes.\\n\\nPublished March 5, 2009\\nEmail this article\\nCRITICAL COUNT\\nFavourable: 1\\nUnfavourable: 0\\nMixed: 0\\nSHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, THE: DVD (2 DISC SE) (MA)\\n(US, 1994)\\nCAST: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows\\nPRODUCER: Niki Marvin\\nDIRECTOR: Frank Darabont\\nSCRIPT: Frank Darabont (short story by Stephen King)\\nCINEMATOGRAPHER: Roger Deakins\\nEDITOR: Richard Francis-Bruce\\nMUSIC: Thomas Newman\\nPRODUCTION DESIGN: Terence Marsh\\nRUNNING TIME: 142 minutes\\nPRESENTATION: 16:9\\nSPECIAL FEATURES: Audio Commentary ; Featurette: New Fish Arrive; Bogs Takes Fall ; Other: A Look Back at The Shawshank Redemption; Shawshank: The Redeeming Feature; Charlie Rose Show with Frank Darabond and Morgan Freeman; The Sharktank Redemption; Still Gallery and Storyboards; Theatrical Trailer\\nDVD DISTRIBUTOR: Warner Home Video\\nDVD RELEASE: March 4, 2009\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130224172825/http://tpnads.com/default/url.php?zoneid=1251&amp;tpn=au\" target=\"_blank\"> <img src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130224172825im_/http://tpnads.com/default/image468x60.php?zoneid=1251&amp;tpn=au\" border=\"0\"/></a>\\n© Urban Cinefile 1997 - 2013'},\n",

PUCCIO\\nConnect to Facebook/Twitter, recommend via email and much more.\\n\"Put your trust in the Lord. Your ass belongs to me.\"\\n--Warden Norton\\n\\nAt the time of this writing, November 2008, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" had the distinction of being the number-one most-highly regarded film among readers at the Internet Movie Database, beating out such heavyweights as \"The Godfather,\" Parts I and II, \"The Dark Knight,\" \"Pulp Fiction,\" \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\" \"Star Wars,\" \"The Lord of the Rings,\" and all the other movies you\\'d expect to see on such a list. That is a remarkable achievement for a film that despite being nominated for a slew of Academy Awards did only moderate business at the box office during its initial 1994 theatrical run, and only gained its enormous popularity through home video.\\n\\nSee if this doesn\\'t sound familiar: You heard about \"The Shawshank Redemption\" when it first came out, but you didn\\'t think it would be something you\\'d want to see. You didn\\'t notice the fine print that said the filmmakers based the movie on a story by Stephen King; you just didn\\'t think the title sounded promising. Then you heard about how good it was from friends. And neighbors. And relatives. And people you met standing in line at the supermarket. When you finally did see it, you loved it.\\n\\n\"Shawshank\" is long and occasionally drags, but it grows on you. I, too, had to allow friends to persuade me to give it a chance. Since then, I\\'ve loved it each of the times I\\'ve watched it, especially this latest viewing in high-definition Blu-ray.\\n\\nThe movie is about two men serving time at Maine\\'s Shawshank State Prison: Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, and Ellis \"Red\" Redding, played by Morgan Freeman. Since Freeman narrates most of the film in a voice-over, it\\'s already a hands-down winner. Andy is a new inmate beginning a life sentence in 1947, having been unjustly convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover. Red is a longtime lifer who eventually takes the younger man under his wing. The movie covers nineteen years of their lives in prison, the slow, unvarying passage of time marked by the changes in poster girls on Andy\\'s wall, from Rita Hayworth to Marilyn Monroe to Raquel Welch.\\n\\nAndy was the vice president of a bank on the outside, and he puts his financial skills to good use in the prison, particularly in doing some fancy, illegal book work for the corrupt warden. Red, on the other hand, is a guy who simply gets things for people; you name it, and he\\'ll get it. Year after year, the parole board rejects Red\\'s release, and year after year Red becomes more resigned to it.\\n\\nBased on a short novel by Stephen King, \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,\" the movie is as much a fantasy as any of King\\'s horror stories, yet thanks to screenwriter and director Frank Darabont, there isn\\'t a moment we don\\'t want to believe in. Darabont uniquely blends humor and violence, sweetness and brutality, in what may be the best \"feel-good\" movie of the last twenty years. Ultimately, it is a story of hope and triumph, a tribute to Man\\'s ability to overcome all odds. Andy never fails to astound us with his courage and cunning. He manages to ingratiate himself with the guards when he begins doing their tax returns and with the inmates when he helps build the finest prison library in Maine. (And managing to get them a cold beer on a hot day doesn\\'t hurt, either.) Andy\\'s final surprise, though, is his best, and it is enough to encourage even old Red to face the real world.\\n\\nIn a way, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is itself a testament to overcoming odds. It is sentimental and stereotyped, yet we are able not only to suspend our disbelief but to root for it all the way.\\n\\nYes, there is the usual sadistic guard like Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), who delights in beating prisoners to death; the compliant fellow guards who go along with the inhumanity; the hypocritical head honcho, Warden Norton (Bob Gunton), who preaches from the Bible while arranging murders in his own penitentiary; and the customary assortment of colorful characters like Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore in a standout performance), an inmate so institutionalized he cannot cope with the outside world when he\\'s finally released after a lifetime inside. But we expect these people. It wouldn\\'t be an old-time, inspirational-type prison yarn without them.\\n\\nIn a coincidental injustice, the Academy nominated the film for a heap of Oscars in 1994: Best Picture, Best Actor (Morgan Freeman), Best Writing, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Music, and Best Sound, and it won none. Admittedly, a number of other good films were up for Awards: \"Forrest Gump,\" \"Pulp Fiction,\" \"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\" \"Quiz Show,\" \"Nobody\\'s Fool,\" \"Blue Sky,\" \"The Client,\" \"Little Women,\" \"Nell,\" \"Legends of the Fall,\" and \"Bullets Over Broadway\" among others. But I\\'m guessing that as the years pass, it will be \"Shawshank\" and maybe \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Gump\" that will turn into bona fide classics, if they haven\\'t already. Oh, well....\\n\\nNote, incidentally, that in addition to \"Shawshank\\'s\" uplifting charms, it deals primarily with a depressing subject, and it is not without its darker side. Bloodshed, sexual situations, rape, and strong profanity earn it a rightful R rating. \"It\\'s a Wonderful Life\" it\\'s not.\\n1\\n2\\nAdd to my collection »\\nAdd to wish list »\\nBuy from AMAZON.com\\n\\nNew price from: $17.00\\nUsually ships in 1-2 business days\\n\\nOrder now »\\nBACK TO TOP\\nFEEDBACK\\nTerms of Use, Copyright, and Privacy Policy © 1997-2009 DVDTOWN.com - © 2002-2009 HDDVD.org - © 2009 DVDTOWN ApS\\nHome:\\nMain\\nNews:\\nMain\\nNews archive\\nBlu-ray and HD\\nMovie Database:\\nMain\\nDVD & Blu-ray release calendar\\nUpcoming DVD & Blu-ray cover art\\nReviews:\\nMain\\nAll Reviews\\nDVD Reviews\\nHD DVD Reviews\\nBlu-ray Reviews\\nTheatrical Reviews\\nHardware Reviews\\nMessage Board:\\nMain\\nMy Town:\\nMain\\nSign up for free access\\nLog on\\nAbout:\\nMain\\nAdvertise\\nTerms of use\\nCopyright\\nPrivacy policy\\nMeet the staff'},\n",

The ensuing inclusion of such familiar elements as the Evil Warden and the Sadistic Guard are undeniably put to brilliant use by Darabont, with the end result a piece of work that - aside from a midsection that\\'s almost egregiously episodic - manages to hold the viewer transfixed virtually from start to finish. Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a mild-mannered banker who eventually develops a deep bond with fellow inmate Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman) during a double-lifetime sentence within the walls of Shawshank Prison. While it\\'s virtually impossible to overstate the effectiveness of the two lead performances, Darabont does a superb job of transforming even the most minor of supporting characters into vividly-drawn, thoroughly compelling figures - something that is, of course, due in no small part to the expectedly accomplished efforts of such familiar faces as Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, and William Sadler. Yet as fully realized as Shawshank\\'s landscape inevitably winds up becoming, there\\'s little doubt that the film\\'s most indelible element remains the touching friendship between Robbins and Freeman\\'s respective characters. The chemistry between the two actors - coupled with career-best performances from the pair - ensures that The Shawshank Redemption ultimately packs an emotional wallop that one hardly would have expected from such an endeavor, and it\\'s consequently not difficult to see why the movie\\'s esteem has grown considerably in the years since its theatrical release.\\nout of\\nThe Green Mile\\nThe Majestic\\nThe Mist (November 22/07)\\nThe Mist, based on the novella by Stephen King, follows a group of disparate characters - including Thomas Jane\\'s David, Laurie Holden\\'s Amanda, and Marcia Gay Harden\\'s Mrs. Carmody - as they\\'re forced to hole up in a supermarket after a strange (and, ultimately, deadly) mist rolls into town. Director Frank Darabont has infused The Mist with a B-movie sensibility that proves to be entirely appropriate, as there\\'s certainly no denying the inherent familiarity of the situation nor the archetypal nature of most of the film\\'s characters. The glut of recognizable faces within the supporting cast does initially lend the proceedings a disaster-movie sort of vibe, though there does reach a point at which Darabont slowly-but-surely starts to tighten the screws and ratchet up the tension. Some questionable special effects notwithstanding, Darabont has peppered The Mist with a number of genuinely terrifying sequences - with a disastrous trip to a nearby pharmacy easily the highlight of the film. But at a running time of over two hours, there\\'s ultimately little doubt that the movie is at least 20 minutes longer than it needs to be - something that\\'s surely reflected in Darabont\\'s emphasis on the religious cult that quickly forms within the market. While it\\'s easy enough to discern the point that the director is making here, the over-the-top nature of these scenes ensures that a little goes a long way. Still, the movie\\'s underlying apocalyptic feel - cemented by the unbelievably grim (and downright haunting) finale - is more than effective enough to carry it through a few slow spots.\\nout of\\n© David Nusair'},\n",

       "   'Critic': '« Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle\\nEd Wood »\\nThe Shawshank Redemption\\nAs I write this in February 2007, over a decade after its initial release, The Shawshank Redemption has taken on the status of a modern classic. People have paid website tributes to it; it routinely appears near the top of the Internet Movie Database’s Top 250 Movies list (as of this moment it holds steady at #2, trailing behind The Godfather; in the past it has resided at the very top). All this for a movie that flopped theatrically, won no Oscars, and had a decidedly mixed critical reception. It has become, if you will, the Forrest Gump that is acceptable to worship because it didn’t take the box office and Academy by storm. People can gush over the movie (which is really no less manipulative than Gump) and feel they’re backing an underdog. It is the large found object of mainstream movie fans, a cult phenomenon that your grandparents could appreciate.\\nNot having seen it since its 1994 debut, I popped in the DVD just tonight, to see what the fuss was about. Had I missed something all those years ago? I remembered it as a good, solid, well-crafted drama, but certainly not one of the greatest films of all time. Having now revisited it, I stand by my 1994 assessment. The Shawshank Redemption, the first theatrical feature written and directed by Frank Darabont (he’d previously directed Buried Alive, a nastily entertaining made-for-TV thriller starring Tim Matheson and Jennifer Jason Leigh), is based on a 91-page story by Stephen King called “Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,” which he wrote shortly after finishing The Dead Zone and eventually published in his collection Different Seasons. (The same collection has also yielded the fine films Stand by Me and Apt Pupil.) Darabont had also, in the early ‘80s, adapted the King story “The Woman in the Room” as a short film, and of course he went on to direct The Green Mile, another King prison drama. All King has to do is write one more, and Darabont can adapt it and complete the trilogy.\\nThe aspect of The Shawshank Redemption that its admirers seem drawn to, first and foremost, is its transcendent theme explicitly stated in the film’s tag line: “Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.” (Indeed, the section containing the King story in the collection is headed “Hope Springs Eternal.” It’s interesting to note that “Apt Pupil” is headed “Summer of Corruption,” while “The Body” — basis for Stand by Me — is headed “Fall from Innocence.”) Hope is a major motif in story and film — the dangers of hope, the necessity of hope. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) appears before us as one of fiction’s dustiest archetypes, the unjustly imprisoned saint (King dusted it off again for The Green Mile with John Coffey). Andy spends nineteen years in jail for a double murder he didn’t commit; his friend (and the story/film’s narrator), Red (Morgan Freeman), is actually guilty of murder — though in King’s story we’re told what he did, whereas in the movie we don’t find out, presumably to preserve our sympathy for Red. For much of the film we’re watching two sane, civilized men forging a friendship among savages, which include a cartoonishly brutal guard (Clancy Brown) and a weaselly warden (Bob Gunton) who in this telling isn’t merely a corrupt hypocrite — he’s also a murderer.\\nDarabont lets the movie breathe; he takes his time, though the film still feels compressed (it’s amusing to watch Robbins and Freeman “age” over the years, getting only a little more stylishly gray every 20 minutes or so). He’s a gifted director, but I’m not sure of him as a writer. His dialogue, when it doesn’t come verbatim from King, sounds inspired by King; when the guard refers to “God and sonny Jesus,” which he never does in the original story, it’s a classic King-ism. What sticks in the craw, though, are the scenes he adds to the story — none of which do much except lengthen the film and add plastic pathos.\\nThe major addition, of course, is Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore in a terrific twilight performance that takes some of the starch out of the character), an old-timer inmate who runs the prison library and keeps a pet crow. Brooks (under a different name) is only alluded to in King’s story, in an anecdote about a prisoner who set his pet bird free upon being released; the bird was later found dead in the prison yard — it couldn’t survive on the outside. King meant this to symbolize the lifers who, upon release, can’t deal with life outside prison walls — they’ve gotten too used to the routine and don’t know how to function in a world where they’re no longer respected for their lengthy time in jail. Darabont had originally planned to have Brooks’ crow die, but decided against it.\\nAs it is, Brooks gets his own subplot in which he is released and we see the tough, sad time he has in his brief existence outside Shawshank. This is touching in and of itself, but the movie seems to stop dead for a few minutes so that we can follow Brooks to his lonely end. Later, much too coincidentally, Red will be released, get a job at the same supermarket where Brooks worked (it looks like he’s even bagging at the same terminal), and get the same room where Brooks stayed — he carves his own name next to “Brooks Was Here” on the wall. If the crow had been found dead (symbolizing Brooks’ own inability to survive outside), and if Red had stumbled upon Brooks’ old room later, we would’ve been able to deduce Brooks’ fate without Darabont slamming the brakes on his movie to spoonfeed it to us.\\nIn the other addition, Andy locks himself in the prison library and plays some classical music over the loudspeakers. Every scarred hardcase in the yard stands stock still, presumably moved to their souls. This isn’t remotely credible, and hints at Darabont’s Capra-esque streak, later to be given full bloom in the execrable The Majestic. Darabont has taken King’s rather hardboiled, Papillon-style tale of escape and upgraded it to uplifting Oscar bait. As it happened, Oscar didn’t bite, being too distracted by Gump and its opposite number Pulp Fiction that year. Darabont is a humane director, as he showed in the rather touching “Woman in the Room” (his best work to date), and he and master cinematographer Roger Deakins map out some appealing compositions of Kubrickian symmetry. He gets a convincingly haunted yet (sorry) hopeful performance out of Tim Robbins, though he also polishes Morgan Freeman’s halo a bit too much. This great actor deserves richer meat to sink his teeth into.\\nThe bit where Dufresne stands in the rain and lets it wash off the mud and grime of imprisonment is presented without irony, though Raising Arizona had already parodied the cliché seven years earlier. Darabont is sincere to a fault, and that sincerity is what the movie’s fans cherish — it’s an old-school melodrama at heart, sturdy and forthright and upstanding, but without a whisper of complexity or wit. Perhaps movies have gotten so cluttered, sarcastic, and insecure that a movie so simple and squarely certain of its own virtue can be lionized as a classic.\\nShare this:\\nFacebookPrintTwitter\\nLoading...\\nRelated\\nForrest Gump\\nJuly 6, 1994\\nIn \"tspdt\"\\nThe Green Mile\\nDecember 10, 1999\\nIn \"adaptation\"\\nDoctor Sleep\\nFebruary 2, 2020\\nIn \"drama\"\\nExplore posts in the same categories: adaptation, tspdt\\nThis entry was posted on September 23, 1994 at 11:22 pm and is filed under adaptation, tspdt.

The 19 years that the film’s protagonist spends behind prison walls is a term shared by the audience. It’s vivid, grueling and painful, and passes with the appropriate tedium and sudden bursts of horror that one imagines reflect the true nature of incarceration. Definitely a film requiring careful nurturing, “Shawshank” will need critical kudos and year-end honors to maintain slow but consistent box office.\\nMostly one is drawn along by the fascinating portrait and the innate humanity of its inmate principals. But it’s a long, serious haul (albeit leavened by humor and the unexpected) that will put a crimp in the pic’s mainstream acceptance.\\nRelated Stories\\nVIP+\\nYouTube, TikTok Eroding Viewing Time Spent Streaming TV & Movies\\nNetflix Top 10: \\'Cobra Kai\\' Debuts at No. 1 With 14.1 Million Views, Followed by \\'Vikings: Valhalla\\' Season 3 and \\'Simone Biles Rising\\'\\nThe saga begins in 1947, when bank vice president Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) goes on trial for the murder of his wife and her lover. Though he strenuously maintains his innocence, his dispassionate demeanor grates on the court. Circumstantial evidence proves enough to land him in Shawshank Prison with two concurrent life sentences.\\nPopular on Variety\\nWhile it’s unquestionably Andy’s story, the chronicle is related in voiceover by “Red” (Morgan Freeman), a lifer who’s set himself up as someone who can get “things” from the outside. He marvels at the new man’s tenacity, knowing intrinsically that Andy is different and that he likes him, quirks and all.\\nWhile the film pays close attention to such requisite matters as sexual assault, staff brutality and the human capacity to survive, it has something quite different on its mind. It’s consumed by circumstance and life’s little ironies, which occur even in prison.\\nThe turning point for Andy and his cronies is a bit of conversation captured during a work detail. A guard bemoans the fact that Uncle Sam will take a healthy bite of a recently deceased relative’s legacy. The ex-banker plucks up his courage and tells him how to keep the windfall. For a moment it’s like Androcles pulling the thorn from the lion’s paw.\\nSoon Andy is put to work in all manner of financial activity. He is Warden Norton’s (Bob Gunton) crown jewel and the source of both an enhanced public image for the man and a quietly acquired personal fortune. It’s not lost on the convicted murderer that he had to enter prison to learn dishonesty.\\nGaining a more comfortable life behind bars proves a double-edged sword. The warden cannot afford to have Andy paroled. The man knows too much, and he is too valuable an asset. So, when the prospect of the truth rears its head, extreme measures come into play.\\nUltimately, “The Shawshank Redemption” is about the dominance of real justice. That element of the narrative keeps themovie from descending into abject resignation.\\nWriter/director Frank Darabont adapts his source material with sly acuity. It’s a fiendishly clever construct in which seemingly oblique words or incidents prove to have fierce resonance. Darabont errs only when he digresses too long on a supporting character or embellishes a secondary story.\\nCentral to the film’s success is a riveting, unfussy performance from Robbins. Precise, honest and seamless, it appears virtually uncalculated. It is the anchor keeping the piece from foundering.\\nFreeman has the showier role, allowing him a grace and dignity that come naturally. It’s a testament to his craft that the performance is never banal. Supporting work is uniformly strong, with Gunton and Clancy Brown, as a vicious guard, extremely credible in their villainy.\\nTech credits are strong, with Roger Deakins’ images and Thomas Newman’s original score providing just the right balance between the somber and the absurd. Terence Marsh‘s sets — on an actual prison location — capture the mustiness and permanence of the environment with aplomb.\\nA testament to the human spirit, the film is a rough diamond.

This reverent adaptation of an unremarkable 1982 Stephen King novella was received tepidly at the box office--due in part to advertising that offered no clue as to what the movie was about--but gained a remarkably enthusiastic following and surprised many by netting seven Oscar nominations. In mid-1940s Maine, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is tried and convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover. He is sentenced to life at Shawshank prison, where he meets affable lifer Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), whose applications for parole are turned down on an annual basis. Known as one who can get things--for a price--Red secures for Andy a pinup of Rita Hayworth and a rock hammer to pursue his geological hobbies. Both items turn out to be crucial parts of a scheme that the mild-mannered banker nurses through years of painstaking preparation. Whereas some Stephen King adapters have seemed intent on transcending or trashing their source material, writer-director Frank Darabont succeeds through fidelity to the text; the few deviations make this subdued male love story even more audience-friendly. The film benefits greatly from elegant cinematography by Roger Deakins and a poignant score by Thomas Newman. Freeman creates an endearing portrait of a decent man with a dark deed in his past, and Tim Robbins gives what may be his most accomplished portrayal. The excellent supporting cast includes James Whitmore, cute as the dickens as old-timer Brooks Hatlen, and William Sadler as a con who starts out scary and ends up lovable. Which brings us to the film\\'s greatest limitation: prison hasn\\'t looked this inviting since 1940s Hollywood. Nothing seems to build character like a long stint at Shawshank, which on the whole seems not much worse than a downmarket summer camp. This makes for a crowd-pleasing story that has little to do with the messy complexities of reality.\\nToday\\'s Netflix Top 10 Rankings\\nIf You Like This Show...\\nThe 100 Best Shows on TV\\nRenewed or Canceled?\\nEditors Pick Your Next Favorite Show\\nABOUT\\nAbout TV Guide\\nNewsletters\\nSitemap\\nCareers\\nHelp Center\\nPOLICIES\\nPrivacy Policy\\nTerms of Use\\nCookie Settings\\nGET THE TV GUIDE APP\\nApp StoreGoogle Play\\nFOLLOW US\\n© 2024 TV GUIDE, A FANDOM COMPANY.

I have not read the book, but my guess is that some of the movie\\'s deficiencies--its old-fashioned morality and portentous message about camaraderie and redemption--are also evident in the original material. Yet, like Only You, it\\'s a handsome (cinematography is by Oscar-winning Roger Deakins), well-acted melodrama.\\n\\nShawshank Redemption begins in l946, with the voice-over narration of \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), a lifer at Maine\\'s maximum-security Shawshank jail. Though there are other characters in the background, the story focuses on the friendship that evolves between \"Red\" and Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a young banker who\\'s serving two life terms for murdering his wife and her lover. As in most prison sagas, we get a representative gallery of types, from the toughest to the most sensitive prisoners. And yes, there\\'s violence in the scenes in which Andy is savagely raped by a gang of sadistic thugs.\\n\\nBut the resourceful Andy uses his banker\\'s smarts and knowledge to wangle favor with the brutal chief guard Hadley (Clancy Brown) and Warden Norton (Bob Gunton), for whom he sets up a money-laundering scheme to cover for his various scams.\\n\\nLong and dragging interaction scenes are occasionally fractured by some action, though overall the picture\\'s pacing is unduly slow. We are also required to suspend disbelief, as the prison break is quite implausible. The filmmakers\\' intention seems to be in making a moral allegory rather than a realistic story. There are also big scenes, as one in which Andy plays an operatic duet on the public system, that don\\'t ring true, but are contained for sensationalist effects.\\n\\nBy now we have seen so many prison dramas that we are familiar with all the conventions of this tired genre. Shawshank Redemption works so hard to please the crowd audience that it often neglects basic plausibility. Moreover, all the characters are basically good, misunderstood, men. And there\\'s one glaring, falsely ringing message: Andy comes to accept his punishment as \"redemption,\" not for killing but for emotional detachment and insensitivity to his wife, which he believes drove her away from him.\\n\\nIf the film is ultimately satisfying it\\'s a result of the superb, multi-shaded performances by both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, two great actors who add depth and resonance to a trice-told story. It might sound as faint praise, but Jack Warner--and Jimmy Cagney--would have been proud of Shawshank Redemption back in the l930s.\\nPrint this page\\nSend this page to a friend\\nReturn to Reviews\\nBack to top\\nREVIEWS ARCHIVE\\nBlood Diamond\\n10 Items or Less\\nCasino Royale (1967)\\nBeautiful\\nThe Conqueror\\nEl Dorado\\nCasino Royale\\nAbsolute Wilson\\nDeja Vu\\nCome Early Morning\\n49 Up\\nThe Hoax\\nThe Host\\nScarface\\nThe Exorcist\\nSuperstar: The Karen Carpenter Story\\nChildren of Men\\nDeath of a President\\nThe Departed\\nThe Prestige\\nRunning With Scissors\\nFlags of Our Fathers\\nDriving Lessons\\nJonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple\\nSchool for Scoundrels\\nmore>\\nTerms of Use\\nPrivacy Policy\\n2004-2006 © Emanuel Levy'},\n",

       "   'Critic': 'The Shawshank Redemption: Special Edition\\nEvery movie trivia buff worth his or her salt can rattle off the titles of at least half a dozen films that tanked when they first hit theaters, only to be recognized later as all-time favorites. Some fall under the \"cult\" banner — Office Space, The Princess Bride (fans as rabid as Buttercup and Westley\\'s definitely qualify for cult standing) — but others are movies that have become synonymous with \"classic\": It\\'s a Wonderful Life and Casablanca are two prime examples ... and so is The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Director Frank Darabont\\'s moving period prison drama (based on Stephen King\\'s short story \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\") earned only $28 million at the box office, yet 10 years after its release, it regularly tops popularity polls. Perhaps moviegoers originally stayed away because of the mouthful of a title, or maybe it was Columbia\\'s ineffective theatrical marketing campaign, which made Shawshank out to be one of those worthwhile-but-depressing dramas that\\'s only for the stoutest of heart. But thanks to home video and countless cable TV airings, Shawshank — which, despite its poor business performance, earned critical raves and seven Oscar nominations — eventually found its audience. And who can blame them for becoming besotted? The story of mild-mannered inmate Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), wrongly jailed in the 1940s for murdering his wife and her lover, and his transforming friendship with veteran prisoner Red (Morgan Freeman) is the kind of inspiring tale that we love the movies for in the first place. Thrown defenseless into a world ruled by bullies in uniform on both sides of the law, Andy comes to understand that his only chance is to believe things can be different. He clings to that hope in the face of nearly insurmountable challenges, not the least of which is dealing with self-righteous Warden Norton (Bob Gunton, who nails the oily condescension of a corrupt man convinced of his own moral superiority), who quickly realizes that Andy, an accountant \"on the outside,\" could be very useful. The cast is uniformly excellent. Robbins\\' glassy-eyed vacancy seems particularly suited to a prisoner who dreams of being anywhere but where he is, and Freeman makes Red\\'s common-sense approach to life seem like the highest form of wisdom. Old pro James Whitmore is endearing as lifelong Shawshank inmate Brooks, William Sadler offers some welcome comic relief as Heywood, and Gil Bellows turns in what is still a career-high performance as cocky newcomer Tommy. And, of course, there\\'s Clancy Brown, who does an excellent job making the audience hate him as cruel prison guard Captain Hadley. Darabont does double duty as screenwriter and director, and his talents in both areas are clear. He makes the most of the contrast between the film\\'s dank atmosphere and stirring message of hope, creating a true classic that will continue to stand the test of time. A fitting tribute to Shawshank\\'s enduring popularity, Warner\\'s \"10th Anniversary\" two-disc set offers the film in an anamorphic transfer (1.85:1) from a source-print that\\'s aged well. Audio options include English Dolby Digital 5.1 and French 2.0 Surround, as well as English, Spanish, and French subtitles. Extras on the first disc are limited to the trailer and a thoughtful, informative commentary by Darabont (his first one, as it happens). The bulk of the bonus features are on Disc Two, which includes a 30-minute retrospective featurette (\"Hope Springs Eternal\"); a 48-minute documentary that originally aired on British television (\"Shawshank: The Redeeming Feature\"); a Charlie Rose Show interview with Darabont, Robbins, and Freeman; the L.A. talent agency-set parody short \"The SharkTank Redemption\" (which stars Freeman\\'s son Alfonso); and the usual round-up of stills, storyboards, and promo artwork.

Quiet and introspective, he gradually strikes up a friendship with the prison 'fixer', Red (Freeman), and over the next two decades wins the trust of the governor and guards, but in his heart, he still yearns for freedom. Darabont's adaptation of a Stephen King novella is a throwback to the kind of serious, literate drama Hollywood used to make (Birdman of Alcatraz, say) though the big spiritual resolution takes some swallowing - ditto the colour-blind relationships within the prison and the violent disavowal of any homosexual implications. Against this weighs the pleasure of discovering a first-time director with evident respect for the intelligence of his audience, brave enough to let character details accumulate without recourse to the fast-forward button. Darabont plays the long game and wins: this is an engrossing, superbly acted yarn, while the Shawshank itself is a truly formidable mausoleum.\\nRelease Details\\nDuration:\\n142 mins\\nCast and crew\\nDirector:\\nFrank Darabont\\nScreenwriter:\\nFrank Darabont\\nCast:\\nTim Robbins\\nMorgan Freeman\\nBob Gunton\\nWilliam Sadler\\nClancy Brown\\nGil Bellows\\nMark Rolston\\nBeen there, done that?

Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top \"prison\" movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well! The film touches upon many subjects, including the ideas of hope, redemption, love, loneliness, justice, life/death, friendship, endurance, fear, patience, inspiration and so much more.\\n\\nWatching this movie always makes me feel a million times better, and if that\\'s not the greatest reason to watch a film, I don\\'t know what is. Give it up to both Freeman and Robbins for completely engulfing their characters with heart, soul and the spirit of humanity. I appreciated the message in this film, I absolutely loved the way it ended, I surrendered to its pace, I enjoyed all of its characters, I thought it was wonderfully photographed, I loved the score and I could seriously watch this movie 10 times a year and not bat an eyelash the whole way through.\\n\\nAnd what kind of banner year was 1994?? PULP FICTION, FORREST GUMP, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL (one of my favorite romantic comedies of all-time) were all nominated for Best Picture. It\\'s really too bad that most everyone got swept by that chocolate-lover, but no matter what the Academy deemed \"better\" that year, it goes without saying that SHAWSHANK has developed an even greater audience and following since that time, and is probably one of the most appreciated movies from the past twenty years (I usually NEVER hyperbolize any of my reviews (this is the BEST EVER...this is the WORST EVER...), but in this case, this film takes that cake and damn well, eats it too!).\\n\\nLove it, watch it, get your own motivation from it and surrender to its spirit which gives anyone in the world hope to do whatever they dream to do in life. It\\'s like I quoted back at the top of this review, you better \"get busy living, or get busy dying\". It don\\'t get more black and white than that.

The judge, noting Andy\\'s lack of remorse, puts him away for life. Andy is shipped to prison, an innocent man slipping through the cracks of a flawed system to toil in its bowels.\\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is an unhurried, engulfing prison drama that tracks Andy\\'s inner cool in the face of outer strife. Amid devastation in which some would give up, Andy puts his life together, piece by piece. As Andy puts it, he can either get busy living or get busy dying.\\nThe narrator is Red (Morgan Freeman), a friendly, beaten-down lifer who is continually denied parole. Red has carved out his niche as the go-to guy for outside contraband. He can get you anything, including a rock hammer and movie posters.\\nWith one look at Andy, Red bets a hefty amount of cigarettes that he\\'ll be the first of the newcomers to cry. Andy makes him lose that bet, then becomes his closest pal. The audience\\'s surrogate, Red looks on with fascinated regard as Andy sets to work making lemon merengue out of lemons.\\nAndy operates with a quiet assurance, always in control and bearing an indefatigable positive attitude. He treats every situation as though it\\'s playing into his hands. Andy exposes the weakness of greedy warden Norton (Bob Gunton), a Bible-thumper and a fascistic disciplinarian. Andy curries favor with Norton by using his accounting expertise to help him launder tax money.\\nThrough subtle cleverness, Andy earns the respect of the inmates and guards alike. He parlays his skills to help those around him, in turn helping himself.\\nWhat lingers long after a viewing of \"Shawshank\" is Andy\\'s calm resolve — his ability to form alliances, his shrewdness in working contacts and optimizing situations — but watch the film fresh and you\\'ll be surprised with the overwhelming adversity he confronts.\\nAndy is marked from the outset by the Sisters, a band of sexual predators led by Bogs (Mark Rolston), and he\\'s gang-raped multiple times. Hopes for exoneration arrive with young thief Tommy (Gil Bellows), who has information that could overturn Andy\\'s conviction. Yet the vile warden, who has come to rely on Andy\\'s presence, intervenes.\\nAndy is the walking embodiment of the Maya Angelou poem \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\" Life can rob Andy of his freedom, his physical health, even his dignity, but his resolve can\\'t be touched. Andy makes it his business to stoke his inner fire.\\nA drama informed thematically by the Alexandre Dumas novel \"The Count of Monte Cristo,\" the film is based on the Stephen King short story \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.\" Frank Darabont penned a sterling screen adaptation. Rob Reiner liked the script so much that he offered Darabont $2.5 million for the rights to direct, but Darabont chose to helm it himself.\\nDue to the seemingly tired subject matter, lack of blockbuster stars and weird title, \"Shawshank\" never caught much of a trade wind at the box office. It seemed that \"Shawshank\" might find its redemption at the Oscars, with seven nominations (including Freeman\\'s in the best-actor category and Darabont\\'s in the adapted-screenplay category), but the film was worked over at the awards, treated as unfairly as Red at his parole board hearings, shut out in the year of \"Forrest Gump.\"\\nHome video and especially cable television were much kinder, allowing the film to find its audience. TNT is said to play the movie an average of six times a year.\\nThrough Andy, Red finds his own redemption. Red seems to be a broken man, in danger of becoming institutionalized like Brooks (James Whitmore), the old-timer prison librarian. Through actions as much as words, Andy teaches Red that Red must cling to hope, if only for the ability to get by from one day to the next.\\n\"Remember, Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things,\" Andy writes Red in a resounding letter. \"And no good thing ever dies.\"\\n● Contact reporter Phil Villarreal at pvillarreal@azstarnet.com or 573-4130.\\n0 Comments on this story\\n$1 Sunday delivery - Subscribe to the Arizona Daily Star\\nEMAIL THIS STORY\\nPRINT THIS STORY\\nLETTER TO THE EDITOR\\nDISCUSS\\nCopyright © 2007\\nGo Back\\nWildcat newsletters\\nARIZONA• sign up now\\nU of A basketball coverage'},\n",

There\\'s a moment in the middle of writer-director Frank Darabont\\'s newly-minted commentary track for the tenth-anniversary DVD release of The Shawshank Redemption in which he marvels at how swiftly and completely that Christian fundamentalists embraced the film (thus allying it with other modern klatch classics like Christmas with the Kranks, The Passion of the Christ, and George W. Bush). He feared, he says, that because the demonic warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is the film\\'s only overtly Christian character, the herd would flock to decry it. Apart from his shocking disingenuousness (if there\\'s a more blatant Christ parable than The Shawshank Redemption, I don\\'t know what it is), Darabont obviously doesn\\'t understand that for the reborn mind, the longer the climb, the better the proselytizing--hence the desertion, the nepotism, and the DUIs actually augmenting Dubya\\'s holiness instead of casting suspicion on it.\\nBesides, no bad deed goes unpunished in The Shawshank Redemption. It\\'s not New Testament stuff, this film; the second part of the Good Book is, after all, crammed every inch with liberal garbage like compassion and sacrifice (small wonder Christ in the Western tradition resembles a hippie). No, The Shawshank Redemption is juicy Old Testament Word, where a prison queen archetype is rewarded for raping Tim Robbins\\' neo-Christ banker (money lender!) Andy with an eye-for-an-eye savage beating, partial paralysis, and every minute until the end of his days drinking his meals through a straw. Not very Christian, this film of no forgiveness, and in a perfect world Darabont would have worried more about offending Christians with that (or the Warden\\'s celebrated suicide, or head prison guard Clancy Brown\\'s humiliating emasculation) than with the fact of one sadistic hypocrite of a bible-thumper.\\nThe film\\'s popularity is easy to understand: it parlays every single prison archetype with a level of Victorian chastity so extreme that it\\'s possible to imagine this as an early Technicolor epic shot in the waning days of the studio era. With the exception of stray blue language (which should prevent this picture, if certain right-wing fanatics forever have their way, from finding its way to network television unabridged--I\\'m looking forward to my daughter turning on the TV some Easter night to watch the unexpurgated The Passion of the Christ, though, as it doesn\\'t contain a single \"fuck\"), The Shawshank Redemption is as coy and retreating as a Doris Day melodrama, albeit one with the single-mindedness of a rape-revenge picture. (Think of Deliverance and the thrill of the piercing of the hillbilly rapist right after he has pierced Ned Beatty.) Andy the hero is wrongly accused and sent to a prison where he meets the usual suspects led by Red (Morgan Freeman), a character whose sole purpose is to marvel at Andy\\'s resilience and offer a comfortable voiceover that smoothes over the uglier aspects of the piece. When Andy\\'s getting gang-raped, for example, Red\\'s honey-warm voice assures us that he wishes he could tell us that Andy got away, but life in a prison isn\\'t a fairy tale. Except that The Shawshank Redemption is, for all intents and purposes, a fairy tale. Andy is the white knight, the warden is the evil wizard, and Red is a damsel in distress saved in the final scene with the promise of happily ever after.\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is a Norman Rockwell painting about the inside of a prison starring a Christ figure who\\'s crucified in the court of man, sent to a dark hole for a while, and reborn on the beaches of Mexico having inspired every apostle he\\'s left behind to spread the gospel of his exploits. Of course, Andy is an assistant banker who screws the man for whom he\\'s laundering bribes and extortions, flaunting the rules of man and the trust of his admittedly corrupt boss for no holier purpose than that he\\'s smarter than everyone else. Holy or not, his story appeals to us a great deal because it first offends our sense of justice, then sates our desire for vengeance with the same dogged determination Andy exhibits in slowly burrowing himself out of prison over the course of twenty years. And yet prison in The Shawshank Redemption seems rather a bucolic place once Andy has dispatched the queers and expanded the library. The homosexual element is eradicable, the race element is never a factor (Red is the only black man at Shawshank in a given medium shot), the cruel guard is domesticated with a tax tip that saves the raging bull a bundle, and the warden is publicly shamed--moreover, he\\'s encouraged to blow his mind out the back of his head before a picture of his daughter. Hurray for vigilante justice!\\nThe craft that\\'s gone into The Shawshank Redemption is, let\\'s face it, considerable. Roger Deakins\\' cinematography is a marvel, with a number of tableaux (note the final rape inside a projection booth, for instance) lit so subtly and skillfully that it doesn\\'t seem as if there\\'s any light at all but for some mysterious glow emanating from the sides of the actors\\' faces. A sequence where Andy hijacks the prison PA and pipes Mozart\\'s \"The Marriage of Figaro\" through the prison to the awe of the literally captive audience is a model of montage as well as the emotional centre of the emotional film (even if its lack of depth is exposed by a similarly-intended scene in Jules Dassin\\'s amazing 1947 prison melodrama Brute Force), while Thomas Newman\\'s soaring orchestral score captures just the right mood of overwrought and overripe. Robbins is fabulous and Freeman, as a character who can\\'t exist anywhere but within the strict framework of this type of film, refashions a cliché to create a brand new cliché unto himself. See Red again right now if you want to in Million Dollar Baby.\\nBut for all the talk of the power of hope in The Shawshank Redemption, what it preaches is a new hybrid religion extolling love with one hand while doling out punishment with the other. It\\'s about blind faith in an anointed martyr who may, in the end, just be interested in the preservation of the self and his reputation (note that Andy doesn\\'t effect his escape until he\\'s betrayed by his benefactor, the warden). And its happy ending occurs because Red has forgiven Andy for leaving him to the dogs as the one person who might have known his plan (he\\'s genuinely ignorant, but as we\\'re often reminded, these prison officials aren\\'t exactly stingy with the beatings and the sensory deprivations), and he\\'s decided not to hope, but to honour his saviour\\'s instructions to the letter at arguably the peak of his despair.\\nAwash with mixed messages and a disturbing sanctimony (bearing in mind there\\'s nothing wrong with rape/revenge flicks unless the victim is positioned as a saint/saviour unsullied by his/her debasement and fury), The Shawshank Redemption has earned its loyal following with its ability to know exactly which buttons to push in these United States. (That and the fact that it\\'s immensely entertaining--I enjoy it every single time I watch it, I just don\\'t respect it very much.) It\\'s a mirror of how the most vocal factions of modern organized Christianity have become a perverse, violent, intolerant abomination somehow capable of reading hatred and exclusion into the New Testament. What are the lessons learned by The Shawshank Redemption but that a film with neither nuance nor irony, a film shot in brilliant colour but cast in black and white, is easier to love than a film that challenges with complicated characters making the best of a complicated situation? (Like, say, Freeman\\'s own Se7en.) A month or two removed from the re-election of one of the most divisive presidents in modern memory, we locate in the ten-year-old The Shawshank Redemption a canny predictor of The Passion of the Christ\\'s success. Morality in 2004 is drawn in straight, brutal lines, and reserved, I\\'m afraid, for the anti-intellectuals in power, crippled, blinded, empowered as they are by unjustifiable victim complexes.\\n1.77:1 DVD capture: The Shawshank Redemption\\nOn a technical level, Warner\\'s Two-Disc Special Edition of The Shawshank Redemption is above reproach. The 1.77:1 anamorphic widescreen presentation is free of flaws major or minor; I looked, I really did, but I couldn\\'t spot any edge enhancement. The colours are (intentionally, I\\'d wager) saturated in the way of SATURDAY EVENING POST covers, and shadow detail in the night scenes is sharp and velvet in the same stroke. It\\'s a showcase transfer matched by a supple Dolby Digital 5.1 mix that, particularly during the rainstorm-escape but also in the bit where old con James Whitmore puts a knife to poor William Sadler\\'s throat (for my money, I like it better when Roberts Blossom cuts his hands off in Escape from Alcatraz), manages to blow the doors off the hinges from time to time.\\nAn alternate audio track features Darabont in his commentary debut, and he comes off as homey and affable, willing and eager to give due credit to his collaborators--especially Stephen King, who apparently gave him crap for making Andy\\'s escape hole too round. Sadly lost in the conversation is the idea of the rape-vengeance cycle--discussed eloquently in Carol Clover\\'s flawed but compulsively readable Men, Women, and Chain Saws--often ending with a vaginal/anal rebirth, though I liked Darabont\\'s revelations that an early cutaway to Andy\\'s hands loading a revolver is actually an insert of the director\\'s own. (It\\'s the sort of anecdote that lends depth to interpretations of the text, something along the lines of Mel Gibson\\'s being the hands that pound the nine-inch nails into Christ\\'s palms.) While Darabont can get a little obsequious to no good effect (we know that Robbins and Freeman nail their respective roles), for the most he part bolsters our respect for him in a way that his subsequent films have not. A handsome trailer rounds out Disc One.\\nThe second platter leads with Constantine Nasr\\'s \"Hope Springs Eternal: A Look Back at The Shawshank Redemption\" (31 mins.), a succession of talking-heads with key cast and crew. I was interested to hear Gil Bellows confirm that the picture is a religious experience for many, which, in all honesty, is a little frightening considering that the film is ultimately a medieval passion play--and the moral is \"follow Andy.\" That idea of a surpassing religious epiphany masquerading as a professionally-mounted estrogen melodrama starring men is continued in \"Shawshank: The Redeeming Feature\" (48 mins.), a Channel 4 documentary that includes testimonials from \"ordinary\" people about how the film changed their lives and pointed them to the path of...what? I don\\'t know--seizing the day? Getting busy living? Therein, Darabont recounts a lot of the same stories he tells in his yakker (among them Stephen King swearing that his novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption would never be adapted for the screen) while Sadler mentions that Charlie Sheen, Nicolas Cage, and Tom Cruise, for starters, were interested in the project. The participants concur that The Shawshank Redemption\\'s was the best screenplay any of them had ever read or could conceive of reading again--where do you begin to argue with something like that? A shrug is the only possible response.\\nAn episode of \"Charlie Rose\" (42 mins.) finds the venerable gabber presiding over a recent roundtable with Darabont, Freeman, and Robbins that\\'s awkward and fawning in almost the same way that any instalment of \"Inside the Actor\\'s Studio\" is, if not as well researched. Hilarity is reserved for the way that Darabont bemoans The Shawshank Redemption getting largely shut out of the 1994 Oscars because it was \"the year of Gump!\" (The films, in my mind, are pretty much interchangeable.) This is scarcely preferable to a junket roundtable, I fear, and expressly for the audience surprised to learn that Stand By Me is also based on a Stephen King novella--from the same collection! By all appearances, the guys seem to like each other a lot. Shrugging again.\\nStarring Freeman\\'s son Alfonso, Natalie Van Doren\\'s short filmThe Sharktank Redemption (25 mins.) re-imagines The Shawshank Redemption as a story set in cubicle hell. Van Doren follows the exploits of wage slaves working on the fringes of the Dream Factory as they look for little ways to rebel against the crushing inanity of publicity work, e.g. trading non-transferable party invitations, scanning Academy screeners for illegal dissemination, and working for a small collection of the world\\'s biggest assholes in the faith that the term \"no hope for advancement\" actually means \"a foot in the door.\" In the manner of a good spoof, The Sharktank Redemption understands the strengths (allegorical treatment of universal story) and weaknesses (long self-important dirge/diatribes) of its inspirations and skewers them with an affectionate persistence. The \"Marriage of Figaro\" sequence reconfigured as a mass-cc\\'d email with a list of alternative jobs is verily a stroke of genius.\\nAn animated \"Stills Gallery\" is comprised of half- to minute-long scored slideshows sorted by their emphasis on Robbins, Freeman, the supporting cast, \"Tim & Morgan,\" or \"Behind the Scenes\" (the sole gallery cracking the one-minute mark at a staggering 3 minutes). The director promises in his commentary that there will be no deleted scenes in this package because \"they\\'re not in the movie for a reason,\" something like a breath of fresh air in this age of directors appearing to love their aborted children with the same amount of fervour as they love the finished product. A \"Storyboard\" sub-menu houses \"New Fish Arrives\" (4 mins.), storyboards set to music that depict Andy arriving at Shawshank, and \"Bogs Takes a Fall\" (5 mins.), thumbnail sketches chronicling a long, unshot passage of the script. I\\'m not sure what the interest in these are, but patience is sorely tested when a text-based preface lingers onscreen a good ten seconds longer than is necessary to have read it. The final extra, a 1-minute thing called \"Shawshank Collectibles,\" is an advert for Sideshow Collectibles\\' collection of commemorative art inspired by and reproduced from the film\\'s publicity materials. Drew Struzan\\'s work is at the centre of this brief exhibition--its brevity, by the by, the only thing that keeps this commercial-masquerading-as-DVD bonus from leaving too bitter a taste in the mouth.-Walter Chaw\\n© Film Freak Central; filmfreakcentral.net.

Likewise, the last movie in which one would expect to find hope is a prison movie. However, in The Shawshank Redemption, hope is exactly what we get.\\n\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is the story of Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins); a man accused of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences. He is shipped to Shawshank Maximum Security Prison, in Shawshank, Maine, to spend the duration of his life. Over the next years (two hours, movie time), he finds his way to inner peace and holds onto great hope in the midst of the terror of the prison system.\\n\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is one of those films that is a true work of both art and magic. It is a work of art in the fact that it can so perfectly paint the picture of a man who will not relinquish the only thing someone cannot directly take away: hope. It is a work of magic in the fact that you are completely enveloped in Shawshank. From the first shot of Shawshank prison -- an utterly gothic structure that permeates you with a sense of just how frightening the prison will be -- you are enveloped inside of the world of Shawshank. You experience a prison life composed of routine after routine after routine.\\n\\nThe performances in Shawshank are top notch. The commentary upon the justice system is both thoughtful and thought provoking. Yet, despite all of its greatness, Shawshank\\'s script leaves a little to be desired. I suppose such happens when one is using Stephen King as the source for a serious movie. Shawshank\\'s characters are cliched. There is Red (Freeman), the convict who gets things, who says at one point \"I suppose there\\'s a convict like me in every prison.\" Also, Andy plays the stereotype of the innocent man, doing time for a crime he did not commit. The story is basically predictable. The dialogue has a propensity to get preachy.\\n\\nDespite these flaws, The Shawshank Redemption is a film with remarkable staying power. It is able to sustain itself throughout its duration and to keep you enraptured with its remarkably hopeful story. In the end of it all, Andy Dufrense will escape Shawshank. You will escape Shawshank. But you will not escape The Shawshank Redemption.\\n\\nThe new special edition DVD includes commentary from director Frank Darabont, two making-of documentaries, and a spoof of the film called The Sharktank Redemption, among other goodies.\\n\\nRATING (out of 5)\\n\\nDirector: Frank Darabont\\n\\nProducer: Niki Marvin\\n\\nScreenwriter: Frank Darabont\\n\\nStars: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows\\n\\nMPAA Rating: R\\nYear of Release: 1994\\nReleased on Video: 10/05/2004\\n\\nBuy The Shawshank Redemption - Special Edition on DVD from Amazon.com\\nBuy The Shawshank Redemption on DVD from Amazon.com\\nBuy The Shawshank Redemption on VHS from Amazon.com\\nBuy The Shawshank Redemption -- the Soundtrack from Amazon.com\\nBuy The Shawshank Redemption -- the Book from Amazon.com\\nRent this film on DVD\\nfrom Netflix\\nBuy this Poster from AllPosters.com\\nWant the freshest reviews?

In my defense, for the most part, neither did anyone else. When Shawshank was first released to theaters it was an abysmal failure. Despite receiving seven Oscar nominations (including Best Picture), it was a film that nobody saw. When Shawshank left theaters it appeared that Frank Darabont’s directorial debut was a failure... and then it hit home video. The next year Shawshank became the most rented film of the year. Since then the film has saturated popular culture, become a constant presence on many “Best Films of All Time” lists, and set a standard for many films to try and live up to.\\n\\nThe Movie:\\n\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is definitely a difficult sell. To hear about a dramatic story set almost entirely inside a prison isn’t exactly something most people would rush out to see. In fact, it’s easy to understand why few people saw the picture to begin with. It’s hard to convey the film’s message of hope in a trailer that only lasts a couple of minutes. It’s really a movie that requires word of mouth to encourage people to see it. So if you’re reading this, and you’re one of the few people who haven’t seen this film by now, here’s my word of mouth - put off whatever you were planning on doing tonight, pick this one up and watch it.\\n\\nShawshank is one of those rare movies that defines the whole reason I love films. It tells a fantastic story, masterfully written, acted, and directed. You can’t help but become emotionally invested in the characters and story, and because of that, the film leaves you emotionally drained by the film’s end, but still with a sense of hope.\\n\\nHope is what the film is about. Telling the story of a set of friends in Shawshank prison, the film is narrated by Red (Morgan Freeman), a prisoner who has already been in prison long enough to be rejected for parole at the beginning of the film. When newcomer Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) comes to Shawshank, Red immediately takes notice of him, and before long the two are friends. Andy is different then the other convicts within Shawshank, and not just because he’s actually innocent of the crime he’s been convicted of. That innocence is actually pretty irrelevant throughout the film. It’s also not his intelligence, although that lands him in good favors, assisting Shawshank’s warden (Bob Gunton) in embezzling money. Instead, we learn over time that the something different Andy seems to posses is a sense of hope. His hope keeps Andy driven through prison’s best and worst and his ability to hold onto that hope sets him apart from the other convicts of Shawshank.\\n\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is one of the few movies that has come out in my lifetime that I consider a “classic film”, a movie to endure the test of time. It’s the sort of movie I could watch a million times and never get tired of. Every time I watch it I am reminded of the power of hope, and reminded that if Andy could hold onto hope through twenty years of solitary confinement, prison rape, and wrongful imprisonment, then surely I can survive through a rough day at work, or a tough assignment, or an overwhelming week of overcommitment. It’s also what makes this movie extremely difficult to write about. The film just touches something inside that’s hard to describe. It has to be seen to be understood, but it’s definitely worth experiencing.\\n\\nThat inspiration isn’t the only lesson I carry with me from Shawshank though. For me there’s also a key lesson in one of the film’s more memorable lines: “It comes down to a simple choice really, get busy living, or get busy dying”. There’s a piece of advice to remember any time you hear someone mindlessly complaining about something. See, life’s too big and busy to just complain. Don’t sit and whine; If you’re unhappy, do something about it. Get busy with life, or sit and complain and prepare for your death. That’s advice to rival anything Yoda could come up with on his best day. Amazing the lessons we can learn from a simple movie, but it’s those lessons that make us want to revisit the film any time we need a reminder...\\n\\nGet busy living, or get busy dying... that’s god damn right.\\n\\nThe Disc:\\n\\nThe Shawshank Redemption has been available previously on DVD, albeit in a bare bones release. For the tenth anniversary of the little-film-that-could, the movie finally gets the treatment it deserves, from behind the scenes featurettes, to the ever so important commentary track.\\n\\nBe aware, the tenth anniversary release is available in two different forms: just the two disc set by itself, or in a Collector’s Box set. The Collector’s Box set holds nothing different on the discs, but includes the movie’s soundtrack on CD and a book that looks at the film from a more “critical report” point of view. This is no typical small, ten-page book though, it’s a full report on the movie including production pictures and interviews. The authors obviously did their homework on the movie, and while it’s not the most interesting read throughout, it is interesting to view the movie through such a critical eye. If you like the movie’s soundtrack though, that alone is what’s worth the price of the set - to have both the film and soundtrack in the same box. Regardless of which version you purchase, the two disc set remains the same.\\n\\nThe most interesting part of the DVD is the one thing that’s almost expected from any DVD release these days - the commentary track. Frank Darabont announces at the beginning that this is his first commentary track and asks us to take it easy on him. Well, I’m not going to take it easy. Darabont’s insightful views on his directorial debut grab you and keep you listening to the commentary long after you might usually turn a commentary track off. It’s not unusual to only listen to a sample of a commentary track when reviewing a DVD, listening long enough to get a feel for what the “flavor” of the track is. Darabont’s commentary held me through the entire film, and then I wanted to go back and listen to it again. I wanted to hear more of what the man had to say about making this film.\\n\\nOften it’s easy to criticize commentary tracks of “kissing ass” of the people involved in making the movie. Although Darabont has a pleasant thing to say about everyone involved, every single bit of it feels sincere. He goes out of his way to point out how each of these fantastic people affected the film, and you get the feeling he knows the film is great because of the accomplishments of every one involved. Darabont, as a director, knows that although the responsibility of telling the story lies in his hands, the knowledge of how to best tell the story may not be in his abilities - especially for his first film. He points out information that normally would have gone unseen, rants about the problems he had with the Humane Society, and gives some insight to breaking into Hollywood and directing in general. Darabont also explains other missing aspects of the DVD release, such as the lack of deleted scenes, which he knows were deleted for a reason, and likens sharing them with an audience to sharing his dirty underwear. I think part of the reason Darabont’s commentary is so good is that he didn’t feel the need to immediately record his thoughts on this movie. He waited until time had passed, perhaps to weed out the weaker memories that weren’t as important, or perhaps so the movie was fresh to him again. Regardless of the reason, I hope he gives his other movies as great a treatment as he does this film, even if it means waiting ten years for each film.\\n\\nThere are two behind the scenes featurettes, three if you include the recent interview with Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and Frank Darabont on “The Charlie Rose Show”. Both the interview and the featurettes offer the viewpoints of the people responsible for the movie, from producers to cast, and their feelings on both the movie and its eventual success. The two featurettes do have a tendency to use the same footage throughout their almost hourlong lengths, both from the film and from interviews. They are both worth watching, but because of the redundancies it’s probably best to space them apart when watching them.\\n\\nAlso included on the DVD release is one of the greatest film parodies of all time, The Sharktank Redemption, which mirrors the tale told in the prison of Shawshank with the story of interns in a Hollywood agency. The most remarkable thing about the parody is the dead likeness they manage to get for the actor mirroring Morgan Freeman’s Red... and there’s a reason for that. The actor portraying Fred Redding is Alfonso Freeman, Morgan Freeman’s son. Alfonso actually was in Shawshank, in a brief on-screen appearance as well as in Red’s prison file picture (as a younger version of Red). In Sharktank he masterfully mimics his father’s narrative skills, and brings the parody almost as much life in half an hour as the full length movie gets in it’s full length. Of course, this is mainly because of the foundation of Shawshank, but it’s still a fun little film worth watching a time or two.\\n\\nThere are some still galleries, which play by themselves to some of the Shawshank theme music, and storyboards as well. I would be remiss if I didn’t also point out that the theatrical trailer is also included, something I’m usually quick to point out if missing.\\n\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is definitely a classic film that will be remembered for years to come. It’s a must own, and this is the version to own - finally a version that gives you more then just the movie to chew on. If you’ve seen Shawshank you already know the power of the movie. If you haven’t, pick this up soon. Its inspirational message may just bring some much needed hope into your life.\\n\\nThumbnails Gallery for The Shawshank Redemption - Tenth Anniversary Edition\\n \\n  Comment on “The Shawshank Redemption - Tenth Anniversary Edition”\\nNote: Comments that are not polite and free of profanity will not be published.

       "   'Critic': \"FILM\\nMUSIC\\nTV\\nVIDEO\\nFEATURES\\nNEWS\\nGAMES\\nTHEATER\\nBOOKS\\nDONATE\\nFILM\\nReview: The Shawshank Redemption\\nThe appeal of Frank Darabont’s film isn’t exactly inexplicable.\\nby Ed Gonzalez\\nOctober 16, 2004 2\\nAbout a month before The Shawshank Redemption was released in theaters, director Frank Darabont showed the film to a crowd of film students at NYU. After the screening, a student surprised Darabont by saying he was insulted by the depiction of the “butch queer” Sisters posse that repeatedly rapes Tim Robbins in the film. Though the student was ceremoniously shot down by the teary-eyed (mostly straight) crowd, a sensitive Darabont managed a semi-apologetic response, pointing out that he had dedicated the film to his former agent Allan Greene, who helped Darabont get the directing gig at Castle Rock Entertainment but who died of AIDS shortly before the film finished shooting. I dismissed it then, but I should have known that Shawshank Redemption would become as beloved as it is now, ranking alongside other overrated “classics” like Casablanca, Schindler’s List, and the genuinely terrible Star Wars as one of the greatest movies of all time (on IMDb’s Top 250 list, the film currently ranks #3).\\nThe appeal of the film isn’t exactly inexplicable. Where Douglas Sirk and George Cukor made melodramas (“women’s pictures”), and directors like Robert Aldrich and John Huston often made rock-solid noirs (“men’s pictures”), Darabont does something in between, ingeniously (at least from a marketing perspective) crafting films for “the sensitive straight man” (you know: that strange breed of heterosexual dudes who don’t have a problem telling a roomful of people they’re about to “pinch a loaf” but are careful to leave an empty seat between themselves and male friends when they go to the movies together). Films like Twentynine Palms use the sensation of horror to plumb our country’s hang-ups with sex and violence, whereas a film like Shawshank Redemption hides Big Issues behind cheap melodrama and noirish shadows. It’s prison life as directed from inside a closet.\\nBased on the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, Darabont’s film follows what happens to Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) after he’s sent to prison for killing his wife and lover. From the soapy courtroom theatrics that open the picture to Andy’s prison escape (how’s that for a dramatic overhead!) and fuzzy-wuzzy reunion with Ellis Boyd “Red” Redding (Morgan Freeman) in Mexico, the film announces itself as Beaches for straight men. King’s best stories, including his brilliant It, are bathed in the glow of adolescent innocence and sexual desire. It’s an aesthetic and emotional philosophy Darabont understands and respects but erroneously applies to a story set inside a prison. Unlike the best prison dramas (like, say, Bresson’s A Man Escaped, Jean Genet’s Un chant d’amour, or any episode of Oz), sentimental twaddle like Shawshank Redemption (admittedly a few steps above a stinking pile of shit like The Last Castle) says zilch about life behind bars and human interaction.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nI don’t mean to be cynical, but isn’t prison life supposed to be a little less nostalgic than this? Shawshank Redemption is supposed to be a drama, but it’s pitched somewhere between an intense thrill ride and romantic buddy comedy. When the evil Captain Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) almost threatens to throw Andy off a roof, Darabont captures the moment with a dramatic overhead. Later, when the old man played by James Whitmore is paroled and discovers that he’s lonely on the outside, he hangs himself in a halfway house. The moment would be touching if Red’s trite narration didn’t imply that life in prison isn’t so bad after all. Freeman and Robbins are excellent performers, but just as the latter is forced to play a hollow saint, the former is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the story’s trite Hallmark-isms. Red’s race and social anxieties never register, and the one time he plays the role of “angry Black man,” he’s dutifully rewarded (how’s that for irony?) with a get-out-of-jail card.\\n“Your ass belongs to me,” says the evil warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) when Andy arrives at Shawshank. Clearly Bogs Diamond (Mark Rolston) follows the same mantra. Twenty minutes into the film, when Andy walks into the mess hall, Bogs pops up his head and looks at the fresh-faced newcomer like a vulture that’s spotted fresh meat…or the love of his life. Naturally, it’s only a matter time before the redheaded leader of the Sisters gang fucks Andy in the ass. Except right before Bogs gives it to Andy, Darabont’s camera politely pans away. “I wish I could tell you Andy fought the good fight…and the Sisters let him be. I wish I could tell you that…but prison is no fairy-tale world,” says Red over narration. The irony here is that prison is a spit-and-polished fairy-tale for Darabont, who would rather linger on an old man feeding a worm to a sick little bird than truly confront us with the humanity of an unjust world.\\nDarabont’s version of King’s story is gimmicky and schematic and panders to our most contrived sexual anxieties and base notions of revenge and guerrilla justice. By film’s end, the heroic Andy has not only escaped prison, but every villain has been punished. Darabont’s lead characters in Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, and The Majestic all bring to mind classic James Stewart roles from It’s a Wonderful Life and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Shawshank Redemption is drenched in movie nostalgia, but the story’s fixation with movies and starlets like Raquel Welch and Rita Hayworth doesn’t mean anything. Just as posters in the film disguise plot twists, the film’s naïve sentimentality undermines serious issues of violence, rape, manhood, and male bonding. Indeed, after the Sisters are silenced, Darabont cranks up the unilateral act of hero worship: prison goes from being “mean and scary” to, well, “cute.” Andy writes letters in order to get books into the prison library, starts doing everyone’s taxes, and wins the hearts of guards and prisoners alike. Someone should bake a pie. Oh, wait, they do!\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nScore:   Cast: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, Mark Rolston, James Whitmore  Director: Frank Darabont  Screenwriter: Frank Darabont  Distributor: Columbia Pictures  Running Time: 142 min  Rating: R  Year: 1994  Buy: Video, Soundtrack\\nIf you can, please consider supporting Slant Magazine.\\n\\nSince 2001, we've brought you uncompromising, candid takes on the world of film, music, television, video games, theater, and more.

Perhaps it was the murkiness of this distinction that resulted in the film\\'s underwhelming break-even grosses when it The Shawshank Redemption Directed by; Frank Darabont Written by: Darabont, based on a story by Stephen King Starring: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler At: Boston Common Running time: 144 minutes Rated: R (language, prison violence) y2 was originally released. But word got out eventually, as \"Shawshank\" went on to become a video chart topper, and is now being showcased with today\\'s lOth-anni-versary theatrical reissue and an more than extras-packed DVD due Oct 5. Tim Robbins stars as Andy Du-fresne, a successful young banker falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He\\'s packed off to oppressively bleak Shawshank Prison, which despite the story\\'s 1940s setting confronts him with all manner of tunelessly hellacious cellblock perils.\\nLuckily and crucially for Andy, there\\'s shrewd but good-hearted longtime inmate Red (best actor nominee Morgan Freeman) to help see him through. Andy is intermittently hopeful that he can somehow prove his innocence, and responds dutifully when Shawshank\\'s stern warden enlists his business skills to handle the prison\\'s books. But as it slowly, agonizingly grows clear to Andy escapist fare that he\\'s being railroaded yet again, he finds the strength in himself to take action, and to inspire hope in Red along the way. It\\'s a simple story elegantly, cleverly told, not to mention expertly acted. As good as Robbins was in nabbing an Oscar for \"Mystic River,\" he exceeded that work with this performance, his face a beleaguered etching of determination staving off despair.\\nIf s a wonder that Robbins didnt join Freeman on the list of best actor nominees not to mention that the film was shut out at the Oscars despite nods for best picture and best adapted screenplay.

Frank Darabont\\'s debut is adored, praised as literally life-changing by some, and so impressive that people are even prepared to forgive its writer-director for The Majestic. Now, after making its reputation on home video, the powerful drama - about two convicts (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) whose friendship is forged in America\\'s most unforgiving prison - receives a welcome anniversary re-release.\\nIt\\'s simple to say The Shawshank Redemption is about hope, but it is also about faith and love. In an age and culture saturated with sex, it allows for a close relationship unburdened by bodily fluids. Enigmatic new inmate Andy (Robbins) and the regretful, older Red (Freeman) could hardly contrast more, yet they connect. They love each other. That neither actor nabbed an Oscar in the year Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump shows stupid is as stupid does, indeed. Freeman, in particular, is exceptional. His performance is so unshowy it can easily go unnoticed, but it\\'s the soul of Shawshank.\\n\"MOVING, WARM AND REWARDING\"\\nThe script - based on a Stephen King short story - is grounded in prison movie cliché: from Bob Gunton\\'s grim-faced, Bible-spouting warden (\"Put your trust in the Lord; your ass belongs to me\") to James Whitmore\\'s wizened old bird fancier. And, yes, the beach-set postscript (filmed at the studio\\'s suggestion) feels slightly overstretched. But the characters are so engrossing, their plight so pitiable, that these issues don\\'t detract from the picture\\'s impact (just as it takes repeat viewings to notice how implausible the ending is). Moving, warm and rewarding, The Shawshank Redemption deserves its release.\\nEnd Credits\\nDirector: Frank Darabont\\nWriter: Frank Darabont\\nStars: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, James Whitmore, Clancy Brown\\nGenre: Drama\\nLength: 142 minutes\\nOriginal: 1994\\nCinema: 17 September 2004\\nCountry: USA\\nCinema Search\\nWhere can I see this film?\\nselect region\\nBedfordshire\\nBerkshire\\nBirmingham & surrounds\\nBristol & Bath\\nBuckinghamshire\\nCambridgeshire\\nChannel Islands\\nCheshire\\nCornwall\\nCounty Durham\\nCumbria\\nDerbyshire\\nDevon\\nDorset\\nEast Sussex\\nEast Riding of Yorkshire\\nEssex\\nGloucestershire\\nManchester & Greater Manchester\\nHampshire\\nHereford & Worcester\\nHertfordshire\\nIsle of Man\\nIsle of Wight\\nKent\\nLancashire\\nLeicestershire & Rutland\\nLincolnshire\\nCentral London\\nEast London\\nNorth London\\nSouth London\\nWest London\\nMerseyside\\nMiddlesex\\nNorfolk\\nNorth Yorkshire\\nNorthamptonshire\\nNorthumberland\\nNottinghamshire\\nOxfordshire\\nShropshire\\nSomerset\\nSouth Yorkshire\\nStaffordshire\\nSuffolk\\nSurrey\\nTeesside\\nTyne & Wear\\nWarwickshire\\nWest Sussex\\nWest Yorkshire\\nWiltshire\\nBelfast & Antrim\\nDown & Armagh\\nFermanagh, Tyrone & Derry\\nArgyll & Bute\\nCentral, Angus & Fife\\nGlasgow & Ayrshire\\nHighlands & Islands\\nEdinburgh & Lothian\\nNorth East Scotland\\nBorders & South\\nNE Wales\\nNW Wales\\nMid Wales\\nSW Wales\\nSE Wales\\nNew Releases\\nIron Man\\nMade of Honor\\nNim\\'s Island\\nP2\\nJoy Division\\nTovarisch I Am Not Dead\\nRate This Film\\nHow was it for you?\\n   1\\n   2\\n   3\\n   4\\n   5\\nAverage rating:\\n5 from 2341 votes\\nYour Reviews\\nGo on, be the first user to review this film\\nRead all of your comments\\nFILMS Links\\nThe Shawshank Redemption 10th Anniversary SE DVD review\\nWeb Links\\nFind out more about \"The Shawshank Redemption\" at:\\nMovie Review Query Engine\\nThe Internet Movie Database\\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external websites\\nArchive of chats with directors and stars...\\nArchive of reviews ending\\n2 May 2008...\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout the BBC | Help | Terms of Use | Privacy & Cookies Policy\\n '},\n",

       "   'Critic': 'widget @ surfing-waves.com\\n\\n\\nArchive\\nVolume 0\\n#1 - 10\\nApril 10, 1995 - June 13, 1995\\n\\nall movies are graded out of four stars ()\\n#10 June 13, 1995 by Michael Dequina\\n\\nM O V I E S\\nPocahontas (G)\\nIt would be easy to dismiss Disney\\'s 33rd animated feature as a disappointment. And it is--not as playful and crowd-pleasing as Aladdin or The Little Mermaid, not as thematically resonant as The Lion King, nor as all-around brilliant as Beauty and the Beast. However, it is only disappointing if one expects the traditional Disney fare, for the studio has rewritten all the rules with Pocahontas, a surprisingly understated and mature romantic drama that just happens to be animated.\\nFor those who have managed to miss the hype, Pocahontas centers around the eponymous Native American heroine (spoken by Irene Bedard, sung by Judy Kuhn) who helped bring peace between her people and the British settlers in 17th century America. The emotional core of the film is her romance with settler John Smith (Mel Gibson).\\nThe quasi-historical basis of the film sets it apart from the fantasy and whimsy that usually dominates Disney animated features, and the animators further set it apart through their drawing style. The colors are not as vibrant, yet bright enough to keep it somewhat detached from reality. Pocahontas is unlike any other Disney heroine in many ways, the most striking distinction being an unabashed sensuousness.\\nThe story unfolds at a relaxed pace, which may turn off the wee ones (the smaller children were obviously antsy during the screening I attended). But the pace allows the story to breathe and the romance to grow at a more natural, less hurried pace. One of the more surprising techniques used by the usually overstated Disney is the reliance on expression and silence. Pocahontas and John Smith first meet in silence, their eyes and faces telling the whole story. Also surprising is the duration of their big kiss; their lips are allowed to linger together longer than probably most children would like. The requisite comic relief comes in the form of Meeko, a raccoon; Flit, a hummingbird; and Percy, a dog. While their silent antics are funny, not to mention pleasing to the kiddies, they can\\'t help but feel randomly thrown in to soften the serious dramatic proceedings.\\nThe music by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz is less pop-driven than previous Disney films and more Broadway, and is more effective as a result. \"Just Around the Riverbend,\" the traditional hero \"I Want\" song, gets into Pocahontas\\'s personality about as well as \"Belle\" in Beauty and \"Part of Your World\" in Mermaid. The sequence in the film is truly striking, with Pocahontas rowing through an increasingly turbulent river (a wonderfully subtle metaphor for the journey she takes in the film). The big showstopper in the film is not a big production number à la \"Under the Sea,\" \"Be Our Guest,\" or \"Friend Like Me\"; in accordance with this film\\'s totally different tone, showstopper honors go to Pocahontas\\'s sweeping anthem \"Colors of the Wind,\" which will go down in history as one of the best Disney tunes ever and is a virtual lock to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song next year. Judy Kuhn does a fabulous job as Pocahontas\\'s singing voice, and Mel Gibson actually isn\\'t half bad with what little singing is required of him. The only flaw in the score is what isn\\'t there--namely, a love duet between Pocahontas and John Smith. Incidentally, \"If I Never Knew You,\" the couple\\'s love theme sung by Kuhn and Gibson, was cut from the film after children in test audiences were getting antsy, for it came late in the film. I think that since Disney is obviously taking a more mature approach with this film, they should have kept it in; while the love story doesn\\'t lose anything in its absence, I believe the two earned the chance to pledge their love in song after all is said and done (a pop version of the cut song sung by Jon Secada and Shanice plays during the end credits).\\nPocahontas marks a major turning point in the history of Disney animated features--it tells a story that does not necessarily lend itself to the medium. Its mature appeal makes it less kid-friendly--and, to a certain extent, less \"fun\"--than the previous features, but it is still a moving piece of work. From the opening shot of a painting of a ship to the closing shot of one of our heroine looking at a ship setting sail, Pocahontas, while probably not a box office blockbuster, is another artistic triumph for the Disney animation division.\\n\\nV I D E O\\nDisclosure (R)\\nBarry Levinson\\'s entertaining adaptation of Michael Crichton\\'s sexual harassment thriller stars Michael Douglas as the victim and a wonderfully bitchy Demi Moore as the victimizer. (Warner Home Video)\\n\\nDrop Zone (R)\\nWesley Snipes stars in this reasonably exciting action thriller about a U.S. Marshal (Snipes) who infiltrates a group of drug-dealing skydivers. Added irony: Gary Busey as an ex-DEA agent. Director John Badham keeps everything moving at a quick pace although he ventures into outright John Woo ripoff in the final act. Snipes is as great as usual. (Paramount Home Video)\\n\\nPrêt-à-Porter (Ready to Wear) (R)\\nThe \"official\" title of Robert Altman\\'s largely unfunny satire of the fashion world is Ready to Wear (Prêt-à-Porter), but the five people (including myself) who actually saw this mess in theaters knows the actual title is the French one (seen in very large letters), not the English translation (seen in tiny type). This is one of Altman\\'s trademark ensemble pieces with interlocking characters and stories; the problem is only one story is amusing (Julia Roberts and Tim Robbins as reporters forced to share a hotel room) and only one character is truly memorable (a ditzy fashion reporter played by Kim Basinger, who should have received an Oscar nomination for her hilarious performance). Sophia Loren, Marcello Mastroianni (whose storyline goes absolutely nowhere), Lyle Lovett, Lauren Bacall, and Forest Whitaker are also among the stars trapped in this sporadically amusing camp mess. (Miramax Home Entertainment)\\n\\n\\n#9 June 6, 1995 by Michael Dequina\\n\\nV I D E O\\nInterview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (R)\\nA box office and artistic disappointment in which Tom Cruise stars as the vampire Lestat, Brad Pitt as tortured vampire Louis, and Kirsten Dunst as their young charge, Claudia. Anne Rice loved this adaptation of her popular novel, but many moviegoers and Rice purists were left cold. The acting is a mixed bag: Cruise makes an admirable stretch as the androgynous, seductive Lestat, and Dunst blows her co-stars away with an Oscar-worthy performance; however, Pitt is truly awful, sleepwalking through his role. The only one who comes off even worse is Stephen Rea, totally lost as the vampire Santiago. Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater are fairly adequate as vampire Armand and the interviewer, respectively. A borderline effort from director Neil Jordan. (Warner Home Video)\\n\\nJunior (PG)\\nCute, amusing, but never hilarious farce about a pregnant man (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Schwarzenegger reunites with Twins director Ivan Reitman and co-star Danny DeVito for only mild results. Emma Thompson steals the show as a clumsy scientist. (MCA/Universal Home Video)\\n\\n\\n#8 May 31, 1995 by Michael Dequina\\n\\nM O V I E S\\nBraveheart (R)\\nMel Gibson gives a passionate performance both in front of and behind the camera with this sweeping historical epic about legendary Scottish hero William Wallace (Gibson), who rallied Scotsmen against English rule. The film is full of electrifying battle sequences that literally involve a cast of thousands. To director Gibson\\'s credit, nothing is romanticized--the violence is unflinchingly brutal and bloody. But while the violence is raw, so are the emotions, and the film packs quite a punch, especially in heart-rending climax--a scene of such astonishing emotional resonance that it blew me away. Braveheart clocks in at nearly three hours, and Randall Wallace\\'s screenplay doesn\\'t have enough compelling momentum to keep the audience from feeling the length. Still, the running time is justified--I cannot see where it could have been cut. A triumph for Mel Gibson, who has a bright future in the directing arena.\\n\\nV I D E O\\nLegends of the Fall (R)\\nBrad Pitt inexplicably became a major star after his unimpressive performance in this glorified soap opera about three brothers (Pitt, Aidan Quinn, and E.T.\\'s Henry Thomas) fighting over one woman (Julia Ormond). Ormond is the only one who turns in a decent performance; not even Anthony Hopkins, as the family\\'s patriarch, is immune to the bad acting bug that strickens Pitt, Quinn, Thomas, and almost all of the cast. I like a good soap opera as much as the next person, but this one, filled with pseudo-mystical mumbo-jumbo about \"the bear,\" is much too hokey to be enjoyed, even by soap standards. (Columbia TriStar Home Video).\\n\\nA Low Down Dirty Shame (R)\\nA mildly amusing action comedy with Keenen Ivory Wayans (who also wrote and directed) as a down-and-out private eye. Jada Pinkett steals the show as his spunky sidekick. The comedy is hit-or-miss, while Wayans proves to be a huge fan of Hong Kong action flicks, ripping off a number of action sequences from them--some sequences and stylistic flourishes (like freeze frames) are directly lifted from John Woo; a character is named Chow Yung-Fat (as opposed to Chow Yun-Fat), and the shopping mall finale more than recalls the ending of Jackie Chan\\'s Police Story. (Hollywood Pictures Home Video)\\n\\n\\n#7 May 22, 1995 by Michael Dequina\\n\\nM O V I E S\\nDie Hard with a Vengeance (R)\\nBruce Willis is back and better than ever as John McClane in this third installment of the immensely popular action series. This time, McClane goes after a mad bomber (a very effective Jeremy Irons) in New York with the help of a reluctant partner (Samuel L. Jackson, whose spirited line delivery more than recalls his portrayal of Jules in Pulp Fiction). Jonathan Hensleigh\\'s script is disjointed and is the weak glue that holds together the stunts and explosions, but director John McTiernan (rebounding after the odious Last Action Hero) pulls the stunts off with such finesse that the script problems are almost irrelevant (except for one final plot point that takes a huge leap in logic and the underwhelming finale). The stars and McTiernan make a very entertaining piece of action entertainment, although one not nearly as effective as the cat-and-mouse claustrophobia of McTiernan\\'s original or the exhilarating excesses of Renny Harlin\\'s Die Hard 2: Die Harder. Note to PF fans: stay alert for the obligatory PF reference, one only the biggest PF fans, like myself, will catch.\\n\\nV I D E O\\nClerks. (R)\\nFirst-time writer-director Kevin Smith took the national critics by storm last year with this hilarious black-and-white comedy about two slacker clerks (Brian O\\'Halloran and Jeff Anderson), one who works at a convenience store, the other at a video store. Fresh, funny, and made for only $28,000. (Miramax Home Entertainment)\\n\\nHeavenly Creatures (R)\\nOne of the most genuinely disturbing films I have ever seen. This drama from New Zealand tells shocking true story of two teens (played to chilling perfection by Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey) whose obsessive friendship leads them to brutally murder one of their mothers. Director Peter Jackson (best known for the tongue-in-cheek horror flick Dead-Alive) creates a rich, haunting atmosphere, deftly juggling the eerily giddy fantasy world of the girls (complete with lifesize, animated clay figures) and their harsh, violent reality. Jackson and co-scripter Frances Walsh were Academy Award nominees for Best Original Screenplay. (Miramax Home Entertainment)\\n\\n\\n#6 May 15, 1995 by Michael Dequina\\n\\nM O V I E S\\nCrimson Tide (R)\\nThe first big blockbuster of the summer. Oscar-winners Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman give incredible performances in this tense submarine thriller. What the film lacks in slam-bang action it more than makes up for in sheer suspense. Great work from everyone involved, from Washington and Hackman to director Tony Scott, credited screenwriter Michael Schiffer, and uncredited script doctors Robert Towne, Steven Zaillian (Schindler\\'s List), and, yes, Quentin Tarantino, who contributes some great lines and character quirks.\\n\\nV I D E O\\nThe Professional (R)\\nFrench writer-director Luc Besson is a major talent (see La Femme Nikita), but you would never know from this stylish, promising, but ultimately boring and unsettling thriller about a hitman (uncharismatic Jean Reno, also from Nikita) who takes an orphaned girl (newcomer Natalie Portman, in a very impressive debut performance) under his wing. After a dazzling opening sequence, this one goes downhill fast, thanks to very little action and unsettling pedophilic overtones. (Columbia TriStar Home Video)\\n\\n\\n#5 May 8, 1995 by Michael Dequina\\n\\nM O V I E S\\nFrench Kiss (PG-13)\\nMeg Ryan and Kevin Kline have chemistry to burn, but it goes to waste in Lawrence Kasdan\\'s surprisingly slow romantic comedy. Ryan is as charming as ever as an American woman searching for her fiance (an adequate Timothy Hutton) in France with the help of a shady French thief (Kline, who is great as usual). After a promising start, the film slows to a crawl during its lagging midsection, only to pick up during the last half hour, but it all comes too late. The frothy confection is all very easy to swallow, but this stew can\\'t help but feel somewhat tepid coming so soon after the far superior While You Were Sleeping.\\n\\nV I D E O\\nMary Shelley\\'s Frankenstein (R)\\nThe most underrated movie of last year. Granted, Kenneth Branagh\\'s take on the horror classic is a little slow and never scary, but it is an oddly moving father-son love story between the obsessed doctor (Branagh) and his creation (well-played by Robert DeNiro). A huge flop last fall, this one should find an audience on video. Merchant Ivory regular Helena Bonham Carter also stars as Dr. Frankenstein\\'s adoptive sister/fiancée. (Columbia TriStar Home Video)\\n\\n\\n#4 May 1, 1995 by Michael Dequina\\n\\nM O V I E S\\nDestiny Turns on the Radio (R)\\nQuentin Tarantino is one \"bad motherfucker.\" But not even he can save this pointless and utterly baffling \"romantic adventure of mystical proportion\" about an escaped convict (Dylan McDermott) trying to get back with his lounge singer girlfriend (a lip-synching Nancy Travis). Tarantino, by far the film\\'s best asset, is wasted in the role of magical gambler Johnny Destiny, whose only apparent purpose is to give the film its title and serve as an excuse for some less-than-impressive visual effects. But at least he and Jim Belushi, as a crotch-grabbing gangster casino owner, appear to be having any fun throughout the campy proceedings. If the thin script by Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone (which was developed at Robert Redford\\'s prestigious Sundance Institute, no less) was able to attract Tarantino\\'s attention, then there\\'s hope yet for my screenplay. I just hope that ol\\' Quentino was paid well for his trouble in what is really a glorified cameo role.\\n\\n\\n#3 April 24, 1995 by Michael Dequina\\n\\nM O V I E S\\nKiss of Death (R)\\nEvents happen so quickly at the beginning of this crime thriller that you wish things would slow down a bit so you could get all the characters and events straight. But sure enough, thirty minutes and a \"three years later\" disclaimer later, things sloooooow down, crawling to an incredibly unsatisfying finish. Be careful what you wish for. Despite strong performances by NYPD Blue refugee David Caruso (as an ex-crook attempting to go straight), a woefully underused Helen Hunt (as Caruso\\'s wife), Samuel L. Jackson (as a tough cop that helps Caruso), and especially a pumped-up Nicolas Cage (as the local crime boss), this atmospheric yet ultimately hollow exercise in tedium is a major letdown from director Barbet Schroeder, who last directed the terrific Single White Female.\\n\\nWhile You Were Sleeping (PG)\\nDemolition Man made her noticed. Speed put her on the map. Now, lovely and talented Sandra Bullock should become a superstar with this charming and funny romantic comedy. Bullock plays a lonely transit worker who falls in love with a man in a coma (engagingly played by Peter Gallagher), only to eventually fall for his brother (Bill Pullman). Never before has the normally sleepwalking Pullman been used so adequately, actually displaying great chemistry with Bullock. It may not be an \"important\" movie, but Sleeping is a welcome ray of sunshine in this current dreary movie season.\\n\\nV I D E O\\nForrest Gump (PG-13)\\nThe worthy winner of six Academy Awards including Best Picture, Robert Zemeckis\\'s tale of a simpleton\\'s (Tom Hanks) incredible journey through thirty years of American history was the most beloved film of last year. Tom Hanks rightfully won his second consecutive Best Actor Oscar for what can simply be called one of the best performances in film history. He receives outstanding support from Best Supporting Actor nominee Gary Sinise, Sally Field, Mykelti Williamson, and especially Robin Wright, who not only should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actress, but should have won. A great film.

       "   'Critic': \"Laramie Movie Scope:\\nThe Shawshank Redemption\\nA classic story from Stephen King\\nby Robert Roten, Film Critic\\nOctober 25, 1994 -- ``The Shawshank Redemption,'' as noted above, is a standard beginning-to-end movie. The dialogue, based on a Stephen King story, is not as sharp as in ``Pulp Fiction,'' but it does have what ``Pulp Fiction'' lacked. Characters worth caring about and who actually learn something about themselves as the film progresses.\\nThe film deals with two convicted murderers in prison, Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, and ``Red'' Redding, played by Morgan Freeman. As the story unfolds, it turns out that Dufresne was wrongly convicted, but is forced to stay in prison because he, a former banker, has become too important to the warden's illegal money laundering schemes.\\nAs the film unwinds, the two men become fast friends. Both find ways to cope with the horror of prison life in the 1950s and 1960s and both eventually even dare to hope.\\nDirector/writer Frank Darabont brings considerable passion to the prison reform message in the story. The characters are very well developed and Freeman and Robbins both are outstanding in their leading roles. Veteran actor James Whitmore is also excellent in a supporting role as the prison librarian.\\nThe film is also very well photographed by Roger Deakins. The production values, in fact, are all first-rate. This is a fine, moving film. It rates an A.\\nClick here for links to places to buy this movie in video and/or DVD format, the soundtrack, books, even used videos, games and lots of other stuff.

       "   'Critic': '  The Shawshank Redemption\\nDirected By: Frank Darabont\\nWritten By: Stephen King (short story) & Frank Darabont (screenplay)\\nStarring: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler\\nPlot Summary - Review 1 - Review 2 - CURRENT REVIEWS\\nHOME: movies.zertinet.com\\nAndy Dufresne is a young and successful banker whose life changes drastically when he is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. Set in the 1940\\'s, the film shows how Andy, with the help of his friend Red, the prison entrepreneur, turns out to be a most unconventional prisoner.[TRAILER]\\nSTEVEN SNYDER\\'S REVIEW\\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is most memorable thanks to its ingenious surprises. Repeatedly, its story is told through misdirection. We think a scene is about subject A, when in fact it is both about B and foreshadowing C. We find ourselves amazed at how much is simultaneously occurring and overwhelmed by an ending no one expects.\\nIt is a seminal collaboration of storytellers, actors and filmmakers intent on keeping the film\\'s real motivations and real pleasures hidden until the last possible moment. And behind it all, as audiences are kept off balance, exist characters and emotions so richly textured and developed that \"The Shawshank Redemption\" becomes a mosaic of breathtaking sincerity. No wonder that fans of the film can point to so many different parts of this masterpiece as their favorite, and all be correct.\\nThe first surprise is its premise: This film is not about prison life. Oh, Shawshank is indeed the name of the prison and most of the film\\'s running time is spent within prison walls. But this is not solely about a warden, guards, prisoners, and the rough prison experience. These are only side notes in a much different symphony about friendship, loyalty, and, eventually, the redemption alluded to in the title.\\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\\'s\" friendship is between two very different people. Red (Morgan Freeman), the experienced lifer, is the film\\'s narrator. He makes his way through prison by procuring items from the outside and selling them to the inmates. Andy (Tim Robbins) is the \"fresh fish,\" as the inmates say, a new resident who is sized up from the moment he steps off the police truck.\\nThis is where the second surprise originates. We think the story is about Red, his take on prison life, his friendship with Andy, when in fact the reverse is true. This is Andy\\'s story. Red is only our eyes and our interpreter. He provides commentary and analysis but, similar to us, knows not until the end what is ticking under Andy\\'s cool exterior. Director Frank Darabont deserves a great deal of credit for remaining true to this approach. Even after the eventual redemption, we are still stranded alongside Red, wondering what has happened to Andy and when we might see him again.\\nSeeing this world from Red\\'s eyes, the audience is, rather daringly, put into unsure situations. Most movies use narration to help fill in the gaps. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" allows Red\\'s thoughts to widen them. In one moment, Red is convinced that Andy is plotting his own suicide. Red worries and frets and thinks of other possibilities. We too follow his line of thinking, being led astray by our faithful narrator. Andy\\'s true fate is more thrilling as a result.\\nOf course, with Andy\\'s fate, I am talking about the biggest surprise of the movie. Among the best endings of any film, the climax of \"The Shawshank Redemption\" actually builds through four separate segments. The first buildup occurs as Red frets about Andy. Red then recounts what really happened in the second climax. Then, Andy enacts revenge on those in the prison, providing a third, unexpected resolution. Red\\'s journey to the beach is the final bookend to a story so intense and complete in its conclusion that its final thirty minutes alone could be a movie on its own.\\nAppropriately, a film as unique as \"The Shawshank Redemption\" continues to surprise us long after the conventional climax has come and passed. As with all great movies, the final resolution is not found within its plot, but with its characters.\\nNone of this would matter without the formidable team mentioned earlier. Based on a short story by Steven King, this film uses the prison as more metaphor than realism. The guards could be any force opposing the prisoners. The prison itself is a tomb in which lives are wasted away. Andy\\'s destiny is strangely metaphoric. Standing in the rain, arms outstretched, he becomes less a person and more the culmination of his earlier talks with Red-the personification of hope that breaks free of the darkness.\\nTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give performances that defined their careers. Robbins keeps Andy hidden from the audience, somewhat aloof in his strange joy amidst Shawshank\\'s despair. Freeman imparts Red with such heart and such subtle intelligence that I find it difficult to admit that Red is not a real person. Freeman\\'s perfect moment comes after Andy\\'s disappearance. Red is in the field, working, and he notes the bittersweet joy he feels for Andy, sad that he is gone, but realizing it was wrong to ever lock him up in the first place. \"I just miss my friend,\" he concludes, and the straightforward honesty is overwhelming.\\nRoger Deakins\\' cinematography is often overlooked. In this film, he finds startling success in simplicity. The interior prison shots are dark and dreadful, but when important moments occur, my how the beauty comes out. Andy\\'s scream to the heavens is achingly perfect. Overhead shots of the prison are gorgeous. When Red goes to find the mysterious black box, another wonderful plot device, could the rural setting look any more like heaven?\\nEven Thomas Newman\\'s score is a triumph. Without guiding the audience to a predetermined conclusion, it accompanies moments with such elegance and such splendor that \"The Shawshank Redemption\" seems to exist free from the confines of the theater. Wisely, he allows the surprise to come first and his gorgeous work to accentuate the audience\\'s gasp.\\nThese surprising techniques succeed thanks to the filmmaker\\'s affection for the characters. Nothing is done at the expense of Red and Andy, their friendship, or their plight. They are at the forefront at all times. When Andy is thrown into solitary confinement, we witness both Andy\\'s endurance of his torture and Red\\'s worry for his friend. As Red and Andy discuss the past, the future, and the concept of hope, important plot points are occurring, but they blend seamlessly into a scene more about the characters in the present than the surprises to come.\\nThe memorable surprises in the film are only the icing on a carefully crafted cake. When Darabont spins the story upside down, it is only after we have invested our hearts and minds into these characters. Only later do we realize the plot has underlined the emotions all the while. We squeal with delight as they win. We feel compelled to rewind and watch it all again.\\nBut second visits, to our surprise, offer insights into more than just camera tricks or surprise endings. There is a plethora of nuances that crave discovery-minute expressions and missed dialogue often not caught in the first viewing.\\nAnd we keep watching also for Andy and Red. They have become like best friends to us, caught in the middle of hell. We watch again because their redemption warms our hearts. Their continuing ability to hope rubs off on us.\\n\\n\\nCheck out Reviews, Commentary, and More at Zertinet.com\\n  MOVIE WEB PAGE\\n\\nIMDB WEB PAGE\\nMOVIE REVIEW QUERY ENGINE\\nShowtimes\\nDAVID JOHNSON\\'S REVIEW\\n[ A group of prisoners, in a corrupt prison, meet a new prisoner who brings a touch of hope. If I saw that today I would immediately think \"crap.\" Of course today I would probably be right. We live in an age where movies are afraid to do the things that The Shawshank Redemption does right. Even the excellent movies of today find themselves hard pressed to create what this movie does. The Shawshank Redemption is a story about people. Not glorified mystical abstracts being played as people, but people. Today Shawshank would either be an action movie like \"The Rock\" or a think piece about the horrors of prison life and the necessary reforms necessary to bring about a better world. Neither of which I am particularly interested in.\\n\\nYet more than any movie I\\'ve seen in a while, my most recent viewing of Shawshank made me think more about the cruel nature of locking someone up and taking away their life (\"They lock you up for life and that\\'s exactly what they take.\") Through the characters in the movie you start to understand prison life on countless aspects. The need for control of the guards and the desire to find some little piece of freedom the prisoners have. Yet at the same time, the movie is not so one sided as to simply assume that each of these characters are innocent victims of the oppressive government. No, most of these people actually committed crimes. Most of them have killed before.\\n\\nMuch of the credit must be given to Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, actors that portray people that we can find ways to attach to. And people we can respect. Tim Robbins plays Andy an extremely private man who is placed in jail for killing his wife and her lover. Andy is an educated man, and lived life straight as an arrow on the outside. Morgan Freeman has been in jail for a while and is the local jails connection to goodies from the outside.\\n\\nShawshank does things well that you might not expect. It has lengthy voice-overs (that actually work well) and it has a sappy predictable ending, but yet these elements work because they are not placed in the over-used, meaningless context that movies today place them in. The voice overs are also consistently used in such a way that distinct worlds are created. There\\'s a real world inside the prison and the surreal outside world.\\n\\nThese two distinct worlds that are created help to place the viewer inside the halls of the prison. They are no longer watching a movie, but feeling it as well. What kind of world do we live in where this kind of movie can no longer exist.\\nMovies @ Zertinet | Oscars @ Zertinet | Main Site\\nIMDB | Moviefone | Movie Review Query Engine\\nContact Us | Subscribe | Unsubscribe\\nBest Viewed at 800 X 600 or greater\\nDesign by David Johnson\\n '},\n",

       "   'Critic': \"The Shawshank Redemption is directed by Frank Darabont in his directorial debut and stars Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. It is based off a short story by Stephen King and, as of right now, is the highest rated movie on IMDB. This film is perfect and is easily in my Top 10 favorite films. I have not read any Stephen King books but his books made amazing films. The Green Mile, The Shining, and Stand By Me were all critically-acclaimed classics and they were all based of books by Stephen King. He can do horror, coming-of-age, and prison dramas and even though I haven't read any of his books nor seen a lot of his films, you can tell how great of a storyteller he is by watching The Shawshank Redemption. This was the first film of director Frank Darabont. For some reason he only directed three films in his entire career, but he is still an amazing director and should be talked about more. Thomas Newman gives his greatest score I've ever heard by him. He did the score for films like Wall-E, American Beauty, Finding Nemo, and 1917. But his score in this film is one of the most epic scores I have ever heard. His score is depressing, but also inspirational. In some scenes, it can be chilling. I'm surprised I haven't seen anything else with Tim Robbins because he is incredible in this film. He plays a character who never gives up and never loses hope and his performance is just so inspirational. Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors of all time. He has been in so many critically-acclaimed films such as Million Dollar Baby, The Dark Knight Trilogy, Se7en, and Unforgiven. But his best performance is in Shawshank. Of course he gets an incredible script to work with. There are so many lines by Freeman that are inspirational in this film. His narration in this film is the best I've ever heard. Morgan Freeman has the greatest speaking voice in cinematic history and his narrating perfectly captures the tone of this film. He also gives a very powerful speech near the end of the film. The introduction to Shawshank is incredible. The cinematography is beautiful. This film is beautifully shot and directed and the film's portrayal of prison life is very realistic. The friendship between Freeman and Robbins is amazing. The death of Brooks is the saddest death of the ‘90s. It shows it's hard for people who are stuck in prison for most of their to go back to living normal lives. Thomas Newman's score in that scene is just makes the scene even more heartbreaking. The third act gives you everything you wan't from a film. The prison escape scene in this film is easily the film's most iconic scene. We figure out that Andy has been planning his escape since he first arrived at Shawshank and then we get Andy escaping in a beautiful-shot scene and Thomas Newman's score in that scene is top-tier music. The ending of this film is my favorite ending of the ‘90s. The ending is very happy and shows that there is still hope for people in even the worst situations. What bothers me is this film got nominated for 8 Oscars but didn't win a single win. It should've won every Oscar it got nominated for because Shawshank is a perfect film and I absolutely am gonna give it a 10/10.\"},\n",

Everything about it, from Thomas Newman\\'s superb score, which is also possibly one of the most beautiful pieces of music I\\'ve ever heard; The Stoic Theme, to the characters and performances of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their best, to the writing, of Stephen King at his best. The writing is one of my favourite parts of the whole movie. Every line feels so profound, like perfect summations of deep human concepts. The whole story is so relatable to our own lives in many ways. The prison, as a metaphor for our own daily prisons we find ourselves in, whether it\\'s our work routines or existence itself, feeling like a prison if we choose to view it that way, and the idea of breaking out of our prison\\'s. Do we \"get busy living or get busy dying\"? Do we become institutionalised into our situations, and accept them, without torturing ourselves with dreams we know won\\'t come true? Or do we allow ourselves to dream and hope and do we try to break out of our prisons? Also the way the story is told is perfect, with the way information is revealed throughout the story, and makes for compelling second and third viewings. This movie touches me so deeply. Andy Defresne\\'s character is so relatable. The feeling of being innocent but then unjustly imprisoned, I feel like all of us feel a bit like that in life. Life is hard, yet I suspect all of us feel a little like it\\'s not really meant to be this way, and we question, do we really deserve the struggles we find ourselves in? But the way Andy deals with his situation and his struggles is inspiring. Watching Andy deal with his ordeals breathes meaning and nobility into my own struggles. To see him fighting off attackers and bully\\'s in prison, makes me less fearful of struggles in my own life. It makes me view my own struggles with meaning and heroism. Such a perfect classic of a movie. One of the all time best. Perhaps the best of all.'},\n",

The film tells the story of a banker named Andy who is persecuted for murder and innocent imprisonment and plans to escape from jail for twenty years successfully. The main character Andy is a person who loves freedom and life, in his life in prison, he still couldn\\'t get justice and he always gets excruciation from prison, but Andy was not destroyed by his experience and reality, he is confident in life and his desire for freedom is even stronger than before, Shawshank is the name of that prison. The movie takes us through his journey in Shawshank and Andy uses his intelligence and resourcefulness to help himself, eventually leading to his redemption. Firstly, a thief was imprisoned for theft, he knew the truth about the deaths of Andy\\'s wife and her lover, Andy excitedly approached the prison warden, however, the warden deceived him and ostensibly agreed to Andy and then secretly killed the thief because he wanted Andhy to stay in prison and assist him with his accounts. But after Andy learned the truth by himself, he bravely decided to gain freedom through his redemption! Overall, the movie also strikes a balance between its positive and negative qualities., Wwhile the film does not conceal the harsh realities of prison life, it can be able to find beauty in these situations and this story also inspired me never to give up easily and to be successful, to search for and pursue my dawn and future, simultaneously, also reminded people that anything is possible. In terms of criteria, this movie is based on its ability to tell a compelling story that can connect with the audience emotionally and intellectually, it is a superb masterpiece around the world. In conclusion, the \"Shawshank Redemption\" is an impressive movie, which guides us to maintain our passion for life.'},\n",

       "   'Critic': \"The Shawshank Redemption is widely regarded as one of the greatest movies ever made, and it's easy to see why. Directed by Frank Darabont and based on a novella by Stephen King, the film is a powerful meditation on hope, redemption, and the resilience of the human spirit. The movie tells the story of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, a man who is wrongfully convicted of murder and sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary. In prison, Andy forms a friendship with fellow inmate Red, played by Morgan Freeman, and sets about using his intelligence and resourcefulness to survive and even thrive in the brutal and oppressive environment of the prison. One of the strengths of The Shawshank Redemption is its nuanced portrayal of the characters. Andy and Red are complex and multifaceted individuals, and their friendship is depicted with a depth and authenticity that is rare in Hollywood films. The movie also features a talented supporting cast, including Bob Gunton as the sadistic Warden Norton and William Sadler as the troubled and tragic Heywood. But perhaps the greatest strength of The Shawshank Redemption is its message of hope and redemption. Even in the darkest and most hopeless of circumstances, the movie suggests, there is always the possibility of redemption and the potential for a better future. Andy's determination to survive and maintain his humanity in the face of incredible adversity is inspiring and uplifting, and the film's ultimate message of hope and renewal is both moving and profound. Visually, The Shawshank Redemption is also a masterpiece. The film's cinematography and production design are both striking and memorable, and the use of music, particularly the haunting and beautiful score by Thomas Newman, adds to the movie's emotional impact. Overall, The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful and deeply moving film that resonates with audiences on a profound level. Its themes of hope and redemption are universal, and its message of the transformative power of human connection and resilience is one that will continue to inspire and uplift viewers for years to come.\"},\n",

       "   'Critic': 'The movies that were called the dark horse of the industry were unexpected and impressive movies that will stick in your mind for a long time. A drama film called Shawshank Redemption is the story of a banker, Andy Dufresne, who was caught up in the murder of his wife and her adultery then. Their story is about the rest of his life in the Shawshank prison, the friendship, and the pain of reality. One of the most interesting parts of this movie is that it is told from a third-person point of view, which gives a new perspective by using an indirect approach. It depicts a lot of inequity in prison life, but the focus point in this movie is hope. The hope that could rarely be found in a place that was called \"hopeless,\" such as prison, is the reason why the movie wants to show freedom in ways that people could never have imagined that people in prison would still have hope. This is not the normal prison film that audiences expect about jailbreak, but this movie leads to a different feeling. It\\'s gained emotion through the situation that the characters have been through, and even more emotion is gained by the impressive ending. The movie always showed you some phases that demonstrated the truth of being human; that will definitely hit you. You will be able to relate a scenario, a character, or a situation in this simple movie to something deeply personal in your own life after experiencing it. This kind of movie is great to keep watching more than once because your thoughts and perspective on it will change as you grow up. Shawshank Redemption could of course be called an encouraging film, and that is also the aim of the director, but in my understanding, this film is bittersweet and more bitter than sweet. Because the character\\'s pain is shown a lot in this film, the key is how he deals with the situation and how it would be if there were a condition in the situation. But what is beautiful is the strong relationships that exist in this place, and you will feel that while watching it. Along with great performances from actors like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, it was one of the best. But there are also live support acts that are absolutely brilliant and impressive. Although most of the scenes of the film take place in a tense place. I would recommend this movie for the two and a half hours that it is worth for people who want to experience a simple but golden movie story like The Shawshank Redemption. You will even more clearly understand why this movie is the highest rated on IMDB. However, I recommended this movie to older teenage audiences because some of the content in the movie is violent, and the context of that content will become clearer to this generation or older. Finally, The Shawshank Redemption offers you a variety of experiences that will definitely give you brilliant pleasure.'},\n",

This movie shines a light on inmates and endites the penal system with the character of Brooks, who is a perfect example of the true horrors of prison. since watching The Shawshank Redemption, I have not watched a movie with a better ending. I wholeheartedly believe that this movie has the most ingenious plot. The story is told so that we don't really realise what is happening until it has happened, but when we realise we can only marvel at the quality of scriptwriting. This movie feels like every single word is chosen specifically to build to something, absolutely everything that happens in this movie is relevant to the ending and that is what makes this movie so good.

There is truly nowhere that this movie falls down; the cinematography is 10/10, the writing 10/10, and the ending 1000/10. I can truly not oversell how incredible this movie is.

This film is nothing short of phenomenal and I can see why it is considered among many as the greatest film ever created. My favourite two kinds of films consist of crowd pleasers and deep dive dramas that focus on certain lifestyles. This film fills both those slots. We get to see how exactly prison affects people and everything that is involved with being a prisoner. We also get some great moments towards the end that put a smile on your face every time you watch it. Across the board incredible acting, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman both give probably their greatest performance, along side the rest of this perfect cast. Tim Robbins character Andy Dufresne gives us the angle of an innocent man entering prison, but not just an innocent man an intelligent innocent and I'll get to why his intelligence is so important later. We get to see Andy go through different stages of prison as we see what happens to people that are alone in prison, how they get targeted out by rapists and how they are treated with zero respect. Then we get to see what happens when you have something to offer the guards and the warden, in Andy's case it's is knowledge of banking. We see Andy begin by helping guards set up savings accounts and help them with their taxes all of which help him get in good with guards. But eventually we get to see how certain guards or in this case the warden may be worse then the people imprisoned. Warden Norton played by Bob Gunton recruits Andy to help him launder money, but once Andy has a chance at getting out the Warden makes sure he can't leave by killing the person that could lead Andy to freedom. This again gives us a great angle into what goes on in these prisons and how guards and wardens take advantage of their authority since they know inmates can do nothing to stop them. We don't find out until the end of the film but throughout his time in prison Andy has been digging a hole to escape, which really adds another layer onto why he does the things he does. Andy has been attempting to make the lives of these inmates better so when he eventually escapes he doesn't feel guilty for leaving his friends in a unsafe environment. We see him build up a large library as well as teach certain inmates so they can receive their high school diploma. Then at the end Andy is responsible for the arrest and ‘almost arrest' of the warden and captain hadley. Another side of prison we get to see are the prisoners who have essentially spent their lives in prison. Red played by Morgan Freeman has become somewhat of a tycoon in prison, as he is one of the people that smuggle into the prison. By the time Red is released he had spent 40 years in prison and isn't accustomed to life outside, so when he is released and begins working he realizes that he is not meant to be outside of prison. Another character in this film had the same revelation. Brooks Hatlen played by James Whitmore was released from prison earlier in the film but when he had that revelation he committed suicide. Red on the other hand was lucky enough to have a friend like Andy. Before Andy escaped we get to see him give instructions to Red on where to find a rock, and under that rock is where Andy had hidden something. Under that rock was a letter to Red explaining where Andy was and that he would love to have his help with a new project of his. That is when we get to see the two reunite in a very satisfying conclusion. 10/10\"},\n",

       "   'Critic': 'Thoughts upon watching this film in 2022: It has the aura of a fairy tale. The prisoners, hard core as they may be, are like mythical creatures: Morgan Freeman as the kindly convict, James Whitmore as the tragic librarian, and Tim Robbins as the soft spoken but conniving Andy. None of them are realistic. They\\'re romanticized. But we\\'re captivated by them thanks to a great screenplay and strong performances. It\\'s a man\\'s movie. This was obvious the first time I watched it. I thought women might have a hard time relating to it. But after my recent viewing, I realized that a great story transcends gender issues and has universal appeal. William Sadler, in an early role, gives a strong supporting performance. Roger Deakins is, without doubt one of the finest cinematographers in the history of film. His camera work in this movie alone could be an entire class in film school. There are so many improbable scenes, like the beer drinking scene on the roof and the scene in which Andy broadcasts an opera record over the prison P.A. It\\'s sheer romanticism—and we eat it up. Clearly, Andy is a Christ-like figure. It\\'s a story that never fails. His \"death\" is his sentence and the beatings he takes in prison. His \"resurrection\" is his prison break. He does good for his brethren, but he has no mercy on the warden. The corrupt and hypocritical warden represents the money changers in the temple, and Andy, in righteous anger, overturns his table. The denouement of the film ties in nicely with an earlier mention by Andy of Robert Frost. The poem in question is \"Mending Wall.\" Those who have read it will understand. Lastly, I\\'ve never understood why this film, now regarded as a masterpiece, was a box office failure. What were people thinking in 1994? Or maybe they weren\\'t thinking.'},\n",

       "   'Critic': \"The movie shows us the life of Andy Dufresne in the Shawshank State Prison from two perspectives; one being Andy himself and the other being Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding, one of Andy's fellow inmates. The initial part of the movie depicts how Andy was convicted of murder; this part is followed up by his miserable prison life where Andy experiences the brutality and unjustness of prison life through not only the inmates but also the wardens. The Shawshank Redemption has been nominated for a total of 43 awards and has won 21 of them. The movie is an excellent choice for a lot of people that enjoy serious drama movies. It depicts the harsh prison life and the unfairness of the world, creating an extremely real feeling of dread that follows Andy Dufresne. It shows us that even though a man can lose everything his story does not end as long as he has hope. This movie deserves a rating of 9 out of 10. Having very few flaws makes it an excellent movie that is hard to rate any lower.\"},\n",

       "   'Critic': \"Warning: Spoilers Shawshank Redemption is without doubt one of the best films ever made, and definitely the best film of 1994. Yes, it is better than Lion King, and I really like that too. It is not only enthralling but powerful and moving too. I will confess that I didn't understand it when I first saw it as a lot happens in the film, and I have now seen it three times. I seriously hope, that those who ignored the film when it was first released now recognise it as a great film, as it really is. The dialogue was extremely well-written, with lines that really stick in your mind. The cinematography and music are both gorgeous, and the prison itself is like a character that dominates the film. In the script, there are some true elements of Stephen King Now I admit I am not a huge king fan, and usually don't like coarse language in books. But in his books like It, which is very good, I have accepted the language represents brutality and rebellion, shown perfectly in the film with the battle of acceptance I suppose between the inmates and the superiors(like the scene with the warden yelling coarse language at the new inmates lined up in a row at the beginning.)The acting was exceptional. I am not hugely familiar with Tim Robbins, but he did a great job in a very demanding role. The best performance however, comes from Morgan Freeman as Red, who was seriously robbed of that Oscar, that he lost to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump. Freeman reminds me very strongly, or his style of acting does, remind me of that of Sean Connery, suave yet very charismatic. Acting isn't just about your vocal range, it's about depth, which was what Freeman certainly had. In short, Freeman was brilliant in what could be his best performance. The scene where the inmates are listening to the Mozart aria over the speakers was a beautiful profound moment, and I actually cried in Brook's death scene. Very rarely do King adaptations translate-to screen well, because of the large scale of the author's books, with the exception of this and the Shining. Some like It and Dreamcatcher are genuinely memorable but have a number of flaws that prevent them from being classed as outstanding. And some, like Thinner and Tommyknockers that border on unwatchable. In conclusion Shawshank is a brilliant film, that is worthy of the credit it has been denied for so-long. 10/10 of course.

       "   'Critic': \"For a long, long time I wondered what was really going on. 9.3 out of 10 possible points on the world's largest film database IMDb, even before classics like The Godfather Part 1 and 2 and leader of some best lists. Yet it's just about a convicted banker who befriends Morgan Freeman and gets used to his life as a prisoner in Shawshank men's prison. But there's a lot more to this film than the blue-eyed setting up of modern movie clichés. For the crux of The Shawshank Redemption already lies in its ensemble. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman as the leading men in their absolute prime as actors. Secondary characters that integrate ideally into the scenarios of the protagonists and all have essential functions as their companions. Villains that seem generic from today's point of view, but for those times were unparalleled in cruelty. All of these ingeniously written roles have a hand in the plot, none of them feeling superfluous at any point. Of course, the film's trump card is the chemistry between Robbin's character Andy and Freeman's Red. After an initial distance, the two grow closer and closer as the film progresses, and within the nearly 30 years over which the plot takes place, they become almost inseparable. A down-to-earth and simple male friendship, where both of them share a terrible fate. How the two manage to carry each other through the cold harshness of prison life is gripping to follow. The individual scenes mainly belong to Robbin's Andy. This one is characterized by Red's over-voice and while this movie tool works in very few cases, it's a bull's eye here. It's not for nothing that Freeman's voice is considered iconic to this day. You have from the start that a man is telling his friend's story. Freeman's screen time suffers a bit as a result, but it doesn't take anything away from what is arguably the best performance of his career. Robbins delivers the much quieter and subtler performance, while Freeman excels in empathetic and even comedic monologues and dialogue at times. The rest of the cast adds to an all-around perfect ensemble performance. Foremost among them is Bob Gunton as the corrupt Warden Norton, under whose hypocritical posturing as a sensible Christian lurks a malicious layer that lends the film some (necessary) devastation. Whether The Shawshank Redemption is really the best film of all time is debatable. However, one thing can't be denied: From an objective point of view, it is without major weaknesses. If anything, the slightly pathetic and conventional ending actually fits seamlessly with the previous plot. In this respect, this is perhaps a point of criticism, but merely one without much significance. Otherwise, it's a film that still did a lot to me at 22 years old, even 27 years later. The sensations of pain, shock and happiness regularly catch up with you. Despite its epic running length and slow build, the film is always entertaining and engaging, and it's also beautifully directed and photographed. Hard to find any flaws here.\"},\n",

Seeing this film doesn't make you want to go in jail. In fact, the message is, first before everything, that everywhere in the world there some place for you. Even though Red found it hard when he went out of Shawshank, he was better free and had someplace where he could do his live. Same thing for Dufresne, he didn't belong in prison, but it was a place where he was able to do something of his life just like in Mexico. So, where I want to go with this is that they had comfort in the prison but nothing beats the life, freedom and not knowing how something will end. Brooks couldn't live in the outside world because HE DIDN'T KNOW what to do of his live and how to be free. So, that's the principle reason why I'm in love with this movie. It's because it has a incredibly strong message that will echo in everyone's head for those who watched the film. Apart from this, I found Shawshank redemption deeply well-written. Each line, every twists and every characters were just perfect. And so was the filmmaking. Let's put this into my favorite films, NOW!\"},\n",

       "   'Critic': \"Based on the novel written by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption is a story about the redemption of humans. The story follows a man named Andy Duphrane who is accused of murdering his wife and the man she had been cheating with and is sent to the Shawshank prison where he becomes friends with another criminal named red. Starring Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, John Sandler, and Clancy Brown, the movie has an excellent cast that knows how to deliver a masterpiece. The story is written in a way that makes the audience care about them and their plight. The highlights of this movie are the costume design and setting within the prison. It captures the feel of the prison incredibly well and makes you feel like you're actually in 1947. The score by Thomas Newman is just as wonderful as always as he delivers an emotionally powerful and heart-wrenching soundtrack. The Shawshank Redemption is a wonderful movie that knows where it shines and a brilliant movie that knows exactly how to tug at the heartstrings of the viewer, with phenomenal writing, cinematography and score. This movie knows how to pull off an excellent screenplay. I recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it before, and even if you have, revisit it, you might even notice something you didn't before.\"},\n",

Every performance is incredible with Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins being the highlight. the set design of the prison is incredible and this movie doesn't hold back from showing how truly awful prison is from the harsh rules of the guards to all the forced labour to the fact that eventually you feel you can't live without the walls of the prison as we see when Brook eventually kills himself (that was really heartbreaking); you really feel immersed in it but it's balanced with a beautiful friendship between Red and Andy's characters and you can really tell they become such good friends. It's also a beautiful story of hope and how holding on to hope and that human spirit will help you survive and that shot in the rain when Andy escapes from the prison is beautiful and we cannot forget that unforgettable reunion betwen Red and Andy. Has some issues though. This movie does have a bit of a bad habit of mainly telling us what's going on in the prison through Martin Freeman's (albeit lovely) narration rather than showing us and also, for people who've been in prison for who-knows-how-long, most of the characters still look the same but regardless, just an amazing movie (A)\"},\n",

I love that the movie didn't focus much on Andy trying to prove his innocence - he knew he was innocent, and so did we, and we also both knew there was no point in trying to prove it. Once you're in Shawshank, it doesn't matter who is innocent or guilty, and that's part of what makes this film so powerful. The characters are flawed and grow throughout the movie, and the ones we lose along the way are truly heartbreaking. My only complaint with this one is that we see a 20+ year stretch for all of these characters, yet only the main ones seem to age at all, and even those effects are questionable at best. It took me out of the film occasionally every time I noticed it. But keeping in mind that this is over 30 years old at this point, it's a pretty minor gripe. This film is astounding regardless.\"},\n",

The story was told mostly through Morgan Freeman\\'s character, Red. Because of this, audiences didn\\'t know entirely what the main character did or thought, which made the revelation incredible and amazing. The relationship between these two characters were endearing, as they helped each other out. The theme of hope was strong and essential to many characters. The scenes with some of the prisoners coming out after serving decades were heartbreaking and made me doubt about hope for these old men. However, contrast to this was the strong determination from the main character. One glorious scene near the end showed just how rewarding hope could be. Also, the friendship between the characters was another way of keeping the hope and dream alive. Overall, freedom at last, and a masterpiece. 9.5/10'},\n",

Directed by Frank Darabont, in 1994-this masterpiece of a movie, revolved around two inmates-Andy Dufresne (Potrayed by Tim Robbins) and Red (Morgan Freeman) and the close bond the two shared. The film is narrated by Red as he reflects on the various trials and tribulations Andy had to go through, whilst at the prison-named Shawshank. A minor detail but the deep baritone of Morgan Freeman's voice, never fails to seduce the viewer's attention and interest. However, no movie or rather-no good movie, is complete without a good soundtrack; This is where Shawshank Redemption's music composer-Thomas Newman, flexes his musical expertise. The soundtrack in the movie is almost akin to a tender dance between two ballerinas-one portraying hope and the other, portraying the melancholy that Andy feels. Apart from this, Frank Darabont's creative decision of playing Italian opera music at a notable scene in the movie-and conveying, without words; the emotions and mindset of every single prisoner at one go. Before we talk about the story-the cinematography has to be applauded. The minor changes in the lighting that usually go unnoticed-but which subconsciously lend to the very atmosphere of the scene is present in spades. Besides, the gross change in atmosphere during a happy scene or a bleak proverbial fog-covering the sad ones, can be found throughout the movie. The story is one tinged with hope, sadness and sheer desperation. Hope for freedom and a bright future, outside the walls of the prison. Sadness at the sight of the heavily armed guards and inescapable layout of the prison, preventing the dream from becoming reality-and sheer desperation to achieve it. The viewer is entangled in a web of emotions as they sink further and further into the movie until, pausing the movie and going about their daily lives becomes a distant thought, nay, a taboo. It is impossible to describe the movie in detail without delving into spoilers-but one has to experience it, instead of reading the words of another. True praise has to be given to the actors Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Their acting was so sublime and so well performed that at one point, one had difficulty believing that they were actors and not real inmates. The level of dedication and commitment the actors had put in, was off the charts and some of the behind-the-scenes and facts about the film, further certify it. To end, one would have to say that The Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies that will put a curse on you-that of not being able to forget it or even stop thinking about it, long after the credits have stopped rolling.

       "   'Critic': 'The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope. Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red\\'s group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.'},\n",

From the violence and disrespect given by the guards to the abuses and beating done from one inmate to another, it was all shown here without ever trying to soften the blow. It also shows us how hard and difficult post-prison life still is, to the lengths that prison changes a person that it can destroy us and mark us even after leaving that dreadful place. The way these facts were portrayed was so real that a person can even feel more compassion for Andy and other inmates for the conditions that every single one of them had to pass, and let\\'s not forget that some of these prisoners were criminals and made atrocious crimes.

There are about as many great quotes in this movie as there were in The Princess Bride, but instead of a cornball comedy, it is a serious drama with non-preachy messages about institutional corruption, the human spirit, the power of mind, the message of hope through hopelessness, and best of all, redemption.'},\n",

The juxtaposition of the dreary, dull prison setting with the mindset of the protagonist is beautifully engaging. The intrinsic theme of hope balances out with the dreadful and horrific situation the characters are in. The main character finds himself in a pretty condemning life sentence for the murder of his wife and lover which he claims not to have committed yet makes most the most of it. The acting is phenomenal and allows for a deep emotional connection with the characters. The ending is wonderfully circular and referenced throughout the film. From my personal experience, I have never watched an ending that is so fulfilling and left me as the viewer extremely content. Although I was always introduced to this film as being THE long film, it did nit feel that way in the slightest. Although, it is not action packed, there is always an underlying activity that can be sensed through the behaviour of the characters and is rather engaging. In conclusion, I highly recommend this film!'},\n",

       "   'Critic': '(Spoiler Review) So for my birthday, I got a 100 Movies Bucket List poster that consists of a variety of titles that also has a scratch-off sticker to reveal an image related to the movie (for Shawshank Redemption it was the small rock pick). As a challenge for myself, I have decided to watch and write reviews for each of these 100 movies starting from top to bottom. And at the top of the list was Shawshank Redemption. This movie was adapted from a Stephen King novel which surprisingly enough, wasn\\'t about something horrific. I knew he wrote other movies that didn\\'t have supernatural elements like the Green Mile, but I didn\\'t know that this movie was any different. All that I knew going into the movie was that the leads were Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman and that it was about a man who was innocent but given a life sentence. The only reason I knew that was because of the film synopsis though, so I\\'d say I went in pretty blind. I think I would\\'ve preferred the film synopsis to say something different than that though because it could\\'ve just said that Andy has been given a life sentence in prison but it also would have avoided saying he was innocent. This would have been a good reveal later in the movie when it is finally revealed to us as the viewer. I mean the back of the Stephen King novel says that the book is about \"a fiercely compelling convict named Andy Dufresne, who is seeking his ultimate revenge.\" Either way, just make sure your film synopsis doesn\\'t spoil the actual movie. But don\\'t worry, you\\'ll have plenty to be shocked about. This film doesn\\'t shy away from dark plot developments, which helps the movie stay interesting while also providing world-building for life in the Shawshank prison. From the first scene within Shawshank, we see a new inmate named \"Fat-A**\" get beaten to death upon his first night there. And although we don\\'t know if he died right away, just the fact that the guards just left him there to die was just shocking. So within our first 5 minutes within Shawshank, we are introduced to cold-blooded murder. Another thing to consider when talking about these dark plot developments is the film\\'s inclusion of the issues of institutionalization. Institutionalization is defined as the act of establishing something as a convention or norm in an organization or culture. If you need an example, take the death of \"Fat-A**\" because most of the inmates upon hearing that he died, were not surprised. They see inmates dying at the hands of Hadley as normal, as they have probably experienced it enough times to not question why. This creates disconnects with Brooks and Red when they are introduced back into society outside of Shawshank. When Brooks leaves, he admits that he misses his pet crow Jake and his job as the prison librarian, as it gave him purpose within that society. The only purpose the new society gave Brooks was to bag groceries, and even people belittle him for not doing a good enough job. As he gets lonelier and lonelier, he starts to think about committing a crime to go back to prison, but he ultimately chooses suicide to end his turmoil. Red\\'s return was a bit different though because he knew Andy left something for Andy outside the walls of Shawshank, and all he had to do was find it. This simple task gave Andy a purpose, a purpose that Brooks simply didn\\'t have. And that purpose gave Red hope, hope for a meaningful rest of his life, hope for finding his old friend, and hope for true freedom. In fact, this entire movie\\'s theme is that hope makes you alive, and that it is the one thing that people can\\'t take away from you. This is shown through the constant struggles of the main character Andy trying to make everyone\\'s lives better within the prison, and holding onto the hope that one day he will be proven innocent for the crime he didn\\'t commit. This hope that he carries throughout the movie keeps him from breaking down crying like other new inmates, so instead, he channels his focus onto making the prisoners feel hopeful again. Among these acts, Andy helped make a better prison library, played music for all the inmates, and convinced the prison guards to give his friends a cold beer. My favorite act though was Andy helping inmates with their high school equivalency test. This was because we got to see the impact that Andy had on individuals within Shawshank, like how he helped Tommy. Tommy became hopeful for his future, and to see him believe that he could be more than just a criminal, was amazing to see. And we too as the audience felt just as proud as Andy did when Tommy passed. But we all know now that Tommy dies right after he passes his high school equivalency test. Now I shouldn\\'t have been too shocked when the warden kills Tommy but I was naive to think that the warden would let Tommy set Andy free. So when I saw it on screen, my jaw dropped to the floor, not because I was shocked by the warden\\'s actions but mostly because I felt so bad for Tommy. This movie doesn\\'t shy away from gruesome death scenes, and they make you feel sadness (like for Brooks and Tommy) but also joy when the warden finally commits suicide later on in the movie. The deaths have such an impact on the story that if this movie didn\\'t have them, I think it would be worse because of it. But Tommy\\'s death wasn\\'t the only twist in this movie because we haven\\'t talked about Andy\\'s great escape. So before Andy\\'s getaway, he got 6 feet of rope from a friend, and Andy never specified what he would use it for. The movie kept us from predicting what would happen by misleading us from the true events, and it does it in two ways. The first is that the movie told us that escaping by using the rock pick was impossible, they even made Red laugh at how long it would take to mine a hole through the wall with that kind of pickaxe. So when he escapes by using the pickaxe, we aren\\'t expecting it. The second way was by making all the characters believe that Andy was going to take his own life with the rope, making us expect that he will be hanging himself that night as well. So when it is revealed to us that Andy escaped through a hole in the wall, we feel shocked as the warden when we see the long tunnel that Andy dug to get out of Shawshank. After this, Red narrates how Andy succeeded in his plan to get out of Shawshank, and the plan explained a lot about Andy\\'s behavior. His confident walk around the prison yard? He was dumping gravel through his pant legs to be discrete. The posters? To block the main hole from being seen, and the other posters to lead attention away from the one guarding the hole. Andy thought of everything and although it took a whopping 19 years to dig that hole, he made it out. If you tell me you weren\\'t smiling while Andy was basking in the glory of freedom while being soaked by the rain, I don\\'t know what to tell you. That moment was absolutely glorious. It was like all the worries and troubles that Shawshank had given Andy were being washed away by the rain. Absolutely beautiful. Now the character of Andy Dufresne was brought to life by Tim Robbins. He was an actor I was unfamiliar with when I watched this movie, but now I look forward to when I\\'ll see him again. Just by his face alone, I always believed him to be deep in thought but since the narration is from Red, his thoughts are kept secret from us, unless he tells someone else about them. If I didn\\'t know he was innocent because of the film synopsis, I don\\'t think I could\\'ve told you that Andy was innocent or not because although he looked like a regular man, he spoke like a very intelligent man who always knew what people thought of him. Heck, even Red was saying how confident he looked for being such a regular man. Speaking about Red, Red was played by Morgan Freeman. Don\\'t worry guys, I promise I know who Morgan Freeman is so you don\\'t have to be worried about my lack of film education, but man Morgan Freeman is so dang good at his job. When I listen to him speak one sentence, his tone alone is so engaging that it just demands that you listen. Hearing him narrate the entire movie from Red\\'s perspective was a great directorial decision as without it, I wonder how much of the movie would really work. But this movie does work, and it makes me so happy to say that I think that this movie is a masterpiece. It made me feel all sorts of emotions from happiness and sadness, it made me laugh, and it kept me thinking about institutionalization even after I finished the movie. This movie was written and directed by Frank Darabont, so I say thank you sir for making this movie. Although I know many people won\\'t read this, I love to think that in some way I\\'m doing you amazing people a service by watching and reviewing your movie. Even if it is a small gesture. 10/10 Thanks to everyone who worked on this project, it was amazing.'},\n",

We follow a banker who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover and how he tries to get used to his new reality. The movie has very good narration to it(classic Morgan Freeman Style). Some scenes are brutal but Frank Darabont used them right, he was not trying to shock the audience but to give what being lockedup really means. The movie shows you how strong routine is and how after being in prison for so long makes it more difficult to live outside than inside. Prison is about free time and times that you try to feel free through some small victories. Personally I believe that Shawshank Redemption succeeds in its purpose but it gave all the answers at the end and I didn't liked that, I wanted to find some of my own. I wanted to let me think if hope is really dangerous or not. Shawshank Redemption is a great movie and I advise anyone to see it, its definitely a classic.\"},\n",

Andy never loses hope and he really \"gets busy living\", because he knows that as long as his mind is free and as long as he has still hope, he will never really be a \"prisoner\". The success of the screenplay and the dirctor can be found in having perfectly managed to arouse complete empathy in the viewer towards a prisoner like Red, who has never denied his actions and who, thanks to Andy, has understood that the conditional release will never be what will make him free, but the awareness, of no longer being that man capable of killing other human beings, has led him to be truly free. It\\'s quite a pity that Morgan Freeman didn\\'t get an Oscar or a Golden Globe for his performance, however he had to contend with a Tom Hanks who brought one of his most famous performances to theaters: Forrest Gump.

On top of that, the acting is top-notch from start to finish, especially Morgan Freeman in the best role of his career.

       "   'Critic': \"The Shawshank Redemption, directed & written by Frank Darabont, is a definitive top twenty-five movie of all time. With the chemistry Darabont has with Niki Marvin & Stephen King, he decided to take a homerun-swing on Rita Hayworth & Stephen King's book. Niki Marvin may only have two below average movies coming into this movie, but she constructed this beautifully crafted picture, being nominated by the Academy Awards for Best Picture. I have seen hundreds of movies in my time, and I'd arguably say that Frank Darabont had one of the best senses of direction; everything just flowed perfectly together, creating this fantastic crime/drama. The story was a brilliantly told, fresh & original take on a jail bird story, being flawlessly paced out, keeping everyone engaged at all times! The overall message of hope & optimism, spoke to so many different levels, giving this movie great layers of depth. The only nitpicks I had with the story, some set ups, and scenes were a little cliché, but tremendously easy to overlook. Deborah Aquila did a great job casting this talented bunch of actors. You can tell all of the characters were invested so much into their roles, to the point where it felt like they were actual prisoners. This was my personal favorite performance by Morgan Freeman. His character is intuitive & so full of knowledge, being a positive figure the prisoners look up to. His character development was the best out of all of the characters, connecting us to his character more & more as the acts go on. Tim Robbins was a diamond in the rough casting. Sure, he's had a few good performances, but nothing before nor after holds up to his performance here. Morgan Freeman & Tim Robbins' characters are basically cut out of the same cloth. Robbins put on such a star studded performance, being so optimistic & witty. His character development is so pure, it's nothing short of genius, making it so easy to get behind his character, and root for him. Seeing Bob Gunton in this movie, being more than a plot device like his previous titles, was pretty exciting. He showed off his talent when the lights were the brightest, putting on a great performance. James Whitmore stood out the most, out of the side characters. His character may not have meant the most initially, but his character development becomes a big part in the overall message. The characters as a whole were very enjoyable, although having a few characters with predictable personalities. The screenplay by Frank Darabont was outstanding! There was so many pieces of dialogue that spoke to high levels, being super clever, and sliding in a few laughs here and there. The score by Thomas Newman (who went on to be one of the most accomplished composers), was an absolute masterpiece on it's own. Newman originalized this style of dramatic & haunting score, adding great tention to each scene. Overall, this movie did everything almost flawlessly. Another movie to see before you die !\"},\n",

Frank Darabont adapted Stephen King\\'s short novel, \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\" perfectly. Not only did he adapt the book to a screenplay, he also directed the film. The directing is very good also. Everything comes together smoothly and makes this movie great and extremely memorable. The dialogue is some of the best on film. There are several quotable lines but more importantly the dialogue drives the plot forward. The use of narrating in this movie is done with great effect. The narration adds a deeper element to the story and to Freeman\\'s character (who does most of the narrating). The emotion and inspirational moments that culminate in this film effectively influence the viewer\\'s feelings in many diverse ways. We feel the character\\'s struggles and triumphs which make this film a rewarding experience. The depth to the characters is very good and allows us to be able to connect with them.

       "   'Critic': 'From Andy Dufresne\\'s (Tim Robins) strong sense of optimism to Redding\\'s (Morgan Freeman) unwavering loyalty, The Shawshank Redemption is a classic that offers it viewers more than what meets the eye. When Dufresne is charged with the murder of his wife and her lover, he was found guilty and convicted for a life time in a prison. Upon his arrival in prison, Redding takes a bet with his co-inmates: Dufresne would not be able to survive his first day in prison. Nonetheless, as the events unfold, what was perceived as a frail man turns out to be the strongest character one can imagine. From the onset, Dufresne was convinced of his innocence. It has to be the sincerity of Dufresne\\'s claim that when met with unflinching hope paved his way towards freedom. The story of Dufresne, though in a subtle way, can be generalized in a sense that it highlights the shortcomings of criminal justice system where presumably an innocent can face severe consequences. It also highlights the inhumane treatment meted out to the prisoners as the proverbial adage \"Hate the crime and not the criminal\" dies a thousand deaths every single day across the prisons. By not portraying what is traditionally expected from a prison movie i.e. violence between inmates, the film certainly seeks to reveal the aforementioned subjects of greater social importance. It also shows that how hard the corrupt may try, he cannot fulfill his responsibilities in a proper way. By showing how Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) used Dufresne\\'s expertise as an accountant to illicitly expand his wealth, the director alluded to Dufresne innocence in a way. By not being able to keep Dufresne incarcerated, Warden Norton\\'s evil came in the way of his duty as the truth of Dufresne subsided the wickedness of Norton. Another important take away is the importance of loyalty as enunciated by the character of Red. Red tried many a time to win parole but was not able to do so. When he got impressed by the kind-heartedness of Dufresne, he befriended him. As selflessness is the fuel of a friendship, Dufresne portrayed exactly that when he negotiated bottles of beer –despite himself being a non-alcoholic– for his fellow inmates in lieu of handling tax matters of one of the captains of the prison. The friendship that was a byproduct of these gestures was what helped Red get his parole eventually. When he got his parole, he kept his promise and followed the instructions of Dufresne, who already escaped the prison, and ultimately joined him on an island, where both lived as free men. The fact that Red chased Dufresne after getting his freedom shows his loyalty and that he was aware of the fact that Dufresne has inadvertently played a role in his parole. With all this said, The Shawshank Redemption indeed is more than just a classic. It draws the attention of viewers to messages such as the importance of integrity and loyalty while portraying the shabby picture of criminal justice system and the fate of prisoners.'},\n",

       "   'Critic': 'THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION \"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies.\" The film is a perfect blend of emotions, thrill, faith, love, friendship , perfect screenplay and a genius narration by Morgan Freeman. The movie, which is based on the novel ‘Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\\' by Stephen King, flows seamlessly in the 2 hours of screen-time. You can\\'t be bored for a second. Surprisingly, Stephen King charged just one dollar for the movie rights. The movie starts with Andy Dufresne, an investment banker, a logical mind (as it seemed in the courtroom scene), getting indicted for the murder of his wife for having an affair with a pro golfer. The movie becomes gripping when Andy is sent to Shawshank prison. In prison, Andy meets Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding ( Morgan Freeman) and his other friends. Andy who is a first-time offender finds it difficult to adjust to the insensitive environment of the prison and fight off Bogs, a prisoner who constantly tries to trouble Andy. The prison is run by wicked Warden Norton and Captain Headley. As the movie progresses, the depths of Andy\\'s character are reflected ever-so bright. Andy is a smart banker, who would outplay you in every aspect of the game right when it\\'s needed. He has a taste for good music and believes that music is something that can\\'t be touched by an external force such as the prison authorities. He has a belief, a belief so strong that it can\\'t be mended by the ‘hole\\' or Captain Headley. The brilliant narration by Red is the most crucial ingredient of the movie. The subtle narration flows smoothly through the varied scenes of the film. The narration\\'s language is backed by the uncanny way of Morgan\\'s story-telling. He doesn\\'t speak words, he sings them with all the calm of the world. Morgan uses words and phrases to express emotions that you think of speaking out loud but can\\'t because you simply can\\'t describe it well enough. Red\\'s narration in the background makes the movie so enjoyable, you could probably listen to its podcast if it ever came out. He gives life to the most epic scenes of the movie, from the \"rooftop scene\" to the climax. He fills it with the warmth of friendship and respect towards Andy. The relationship between Red and Andy Dufresne transcends the boundaries of conventional friendship. Red was more than a friend to Dufresne. From getting things from the outside to making him believe they were all innocent, Red was one guy Andy could always talk to. The story revolves around Andy and his uncanny way of handling troubles. Andy was just a bird who wasn\\'t meant to be caged, his feathers were just too bright. It was a sin to keep him there. Andy changed the whole perspective of Red and the viewers too. He taught us that there are things that no one can take from you, it is deep inside you. It is called Hope. And as Andy finally succeeds to make Red, along with the viewers, believe that hope is a good thing. The story unfolds with an essence of love and life in it. It is not a conventional prison escape, as you might expect, it is a once in a century movie that teaches you the little things of life, it relaxes you to immeasurable comfort, makes you forget your problems and gives you a memory that you will treasure and share with your loved ones forever. It is a movie that will live on forever.'},\n",

       "   'Critic': 'For such a beloved and widely praised film I am surprised it took me so long to get around to watching it as I have seen far less popular 1990s Best Picture nominees such as The Thin Red Line (1998) and Shine (1996). I must say that it didn\\'t quite grab me the way it must for those who proclaim it to be uplifting and heartfelt but maybe with repeat viewings I will be able to fully understand it\\'s appeal. This is not to say that I did not enjoy the film and understand that it was an exceptionally well crafted piece of cinema with some lovely moments in amongst the overly cloying and emotionally manipulative ones. In 1947, wealthy banker Andy Dufresne, Tim Robbins, is sentenced to life in prison after being wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He proves himself to be resilient and patient in prison as he does not draw the ire of the prison guards and easily befriends the resourceful Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, Morgan Freeman, who is able to smuggle items into the prison. Dufresne uses his skill as a banker to ingratiate himself with warden Samuel Norton, Bob Gunton, and gain privileges such as being able to retain a smuggled posters of sex symbols in his bedroom. He builds up a library over time and begins to discuss the prospect of escaping as one of his friends commits suicide when he finally leaves prison and the corruption of those running the prison gets worse. Dufresne and Redding never lose the will to keep living over the years and a seemingly miraculous event uplifts the two of them and provides them with inspiration to live out the dreams that they described to one another in prison. Where the film finds itself is in exploring the bond that develops between groups of downtrodden people as they have a camaraderie built on mutual respect and the same fears which they discuss with rambunctious humor. Of course Dufresne\\'s rise is slightly fantastical as it is shocking that a corrupt leader would allow an underling of very apparent intelligence this amount of access to valuable secrets that could easily be used against him. But there is such pleasure to be found in this wishful thinking as a kind group of men who are willing to put in the effort to gain the privileges that enrich their lives so much. Darabont\\'s adaptation of Stephen King\\'s short story onto the screen works nicely as it focuses in on these small interactions and never gets too lost in the espionage occurring in the background or the fights between the guards and the prisoners. Robbins and Freeman also make fantastic leads as they are both incredibly likable while leaving a certain enigmatic quality alive in their characters. We never do know too much about these characters before their time in prison and because Redding appears to have been so young this makes sense, he really never lived before serving time, while our unease about Dufresne serves to put us in the headspace of the other prisoners. We are left to assume that he did not kill his wife and it was instead another man, a burglar known to a young prisoner whom Dufresne mentors, is responsible but he always remains somewhat at a distance from the other men and the audience. Redding speaks of him reverentially as a man of qualities to aspire to and even in their final meeting it is Dufresne who has shown Redding the way and who stands independent and self-sufficient on the beach. Fortunately this does not make us dislike him but allows us to understand some of the more ‘magical\\' elements of the film as it is Redding recounting the story and he does not view Dufresne as a normal man but a figure capable of extraordinary acts. Elements of the film that I did not appreciate were the score which laid on the sentimentality thick and an unnecessary subplot in which a former prisoner commits suicide. Thomas Newman can bring enormous emotional depth to film\\'s that lack in obvious visual symbolism and pathos but this is a very obviously sweeping and emotional film so it would have been nice to have a slightly more stripped down, restrained score to leave the audience some room to interpret the meaning of certain scenes for themselves. The suicide subplot felt the most false of all of the emotional strands in the film and I would have liked to see an issue with as much importance and pain attached to it treated with more respected and not milked for an emotional response from the audience.'},\n",

In the film it shows all the emotions fear, anger and disappointment. I have to say in this film my favourite character is Brooks played amazingly by James Whitmore with his range of emotions from his anger at another prisoner for being let go is so well done and I also think it is so sad that when he is free he still takes his own life as it is not like how he imagined it. Another great thing about this film is the warden played by Bob Gunton who when ever I think about film antagonists I always think about the terrible things this man did and it feels so satisfying when he finally gets his comeuppance at the end. The best thing in this film is the end, when the guards check behind the 1000000 B.C poster and the hole and you see Andy at the other end kneeling in the rain and getting Ellis out of prison and seeing them reunite is so satisfying. In conclusion this is one of the best films of all time from characters, emotions and a satisfying conclusion all lead to an amazing film.'},\n",

Frank Darabont's prison drama The Shawshank Redemption (1994) will bring you to tears as its simple honesty and brutal trauma explore the prison industrial complex. Stephen King's story is a profound and timeless parable on the effects of political corruption, police brutality, legal loopholes, and prison life. You will find someone to relate to herein as The Shawshank Redemption remains one of the greatest films of all time because it champions hope, bravery, kindness, empathy, friendship, and freedom. King's writing is brilliant and poignant with realistic drama stemming from horrendous cruelty and glaring flaws within the justice system. The Shawshank Redemption is an apt companion to The Green Mile, Escape from Alcatraz, and Cool Hand Luke. Darabont's direction is stellar as he keeps your attention in every scene. You are completely swept into Shawshank's gritty world of broken men. Darabont finds new ways to coherently tell King's compelling story, so that you are always intrigued at where the story is going. Roger Deakins' cinematography is stunning and warm with many of his most clever shots herein. A shot looking down from the sky with a man's arms to represent freedom is absolute genius. Thomas Newman's score is riveting as it only chimes in to reaffirm The Shawshank Redemption's mysterious, intense, scary, or emotional sequences. Newman elevates a gorgeous film into a moving one. Tim Robbins is perfect as the intelligent lead Andy Dufresne. Robbins portrays one of cinema's most thoughtful, pensive, and sympathetic figures with an empathetic face, eyes, voice, movement, and persona. Robbins is as brilliant in The Shawshank Redemption as he is in Mystic River. Robbins is a phenomenal actor because he depicts large themes in subtle displays of acting. Morgan Freeman is as affecting as Robbins because Freeman gives his inmate, Red, a distinct air of hopelessness. His character has given up until he befriends the optimistic and motivated Dufresne. On the other hand, Bob Gunton is brutal and vile as the revoltingly corrupt and cruel Warden Samuel Norton. He knows how to appear fearsome without screaming. His quiet fuming and purposeful vindictiveness is astounding as Gunton acts to peak villainy. Overall, The Shawshank Redemption is a revelation in allowing an audience to empathize with prisoners on a personal level. You should watch it as I'm certain you will love it.\"},\n",

Another aspect that I love of this movie are the actors, Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, Bob Gunton, etc. the cast is excellent. It's not a surprise to me that the movie awarded some important prices like for example: Best DVD/Blu-Ray Collection, Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography in Theatrical Releases, Best Adapted Screenplay, etc. This movie is really a jewel and I strongly believe that is a candidate that can't be missed in the list of films you should definetly watch before you die.\"},\n",

Really good style with the colour scheme and atmosphere. Exemplary action that is really tense and emotional. Really good sound design. Really good and quotable dialogue. Perfect editing that cut at the wright time. The soundtrack also fit the film really well. Really good story that is fleshed out over 19 years. Great atmosphere with the silence and cinematography. The film also has great emotion that personally made me cry a lot. The film is also extremely enjoyable. The film also has a big praise because I dont like narration but this film does it perfectly. Over all I give Shawshank redemption a 10/10 - perfection'},\n",

When I first saw this movie a couple years ago, I was enthralled from the beginning until the very satisfying ending. The direction from Frank Darabont throughout just kept pulling me in to this world and made what is probably one of the best prison dramas ever. He was able to develop a very heart felt story and made you feel you in Shawshank Prison with all of them. The characters all felt real and every scene was beautifully crafted from the best and worst parts in prison. Some of my favorite scenes were Morgan Freeman's Red in the parole room and how he answers each time shows his development as a character and his friendship with Tim Robbins' Andy as a motivation in the end. The scenes where Andy was helping out in the prison and his motivation to get out and dream to be on a beach near the Pacific was another great part of what is already an amazing film overall. Other characters like the Warden, and Brooks helped move the story in different ways, but were important in their roles as well. The movie also knows when to tug at your heartstrings and does in perfectly, and the ending is still one of my favorites to this day.\"},\n",

It does not spoon feed you information and it allows for viewers to truly become immersed in the story. Based on the novella by Stephen King, we get to witness a master class in storytelling, character development and an early example of plot twists coming out of nowhere. Following the unlucky story of Andy Dufresne as he navigates the brutal, unforgiving life of a maximum security prison inmate, we get to watch this brilliant former banker manipulate his way through the system and leave those in charge believing they have him by the short and curlies when in reality he was playing them like instruments the whole time. On his journey, he is joined by Red, a man who can get things and is always there to lend a helping hand, ear or advice whenever needed. We also meet Brooks, an elderly man who has spent the majority of his life incarcerated within Shawshank\\'s walls. As the story unfolds, we watch as Brooks leaves the prison, only to become entrenched in that life even on the outside. It leads him to suicide in a scene that is as heart-wrenching as it is educational (showcasing the downside of long terms in prison and becoming institutionalized). We also lay witness to Andy weaselling himself in to the financials of the prison and creating a persona that technically does not exist. Everything culminates in the escape of the century, a man desperate for freedom crawling through the sewage pipe, not knowing what is on the other side, not caring just wanting out. Red so poignantly states, \"He crawled through 500 yards of shit and came out clean on the other side.\" This is a movie that needs to be on everybody\\'s to watch list.'},\n",

       "   'Critic': \"Hoping for Redemption Spiritual and uplifting, The Shawshank Redemption is an old-fashioned prison flick that leaves you with lots to think about. Gripping you to your seat, the motion picture wrestles with your heart leaving you speechless. Released in 1994, both Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Red transcend through their characters and bring you back to the 1940s. Based on famous author Stephen Kingï¿ 1/2(TM)s short story Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, this film shows the beauty of actress Rita Hayworth as the symbol of hope throughout Robbinsï¿ 1/2(TM) time in his lonely jail cell. ï¿ 1/2Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever diesï¿ 1/2Â?. Only explained in the last few minutes of the movie, the theme of hope is woven through the movie. Up-and-comer Frank Darabont directed this marvelous film. Darabont later went on to direct The Green Mile and The Walking Dead but is still most recognized for his ingenious work directing one of his first films, The Shawshank Redemption. As it may seem long, slow and at some points too outwardly sentimental, it all adds to the overarching theme of hope throughout the film. Falsely convicted of killing his wife and her lover, Robbins is sentenced to life in prison. During his first couple years, heï¿ 1/2(TM)s harassed by the warden, beaten by the guards, and sexually abused by inmates. It takes Robbins a few years to fit in at the penitentiary but he evolves into one of the most cherished inmates. Darabont created one magnificent scene mastering the use of acting and photography. One day, a few lucky inmates were tasked with tarring the roof of a prison building, including Robbins and they all heard the guards talking. The captain of the guards, Captain Hadley, was going to inherit $35,000 after his brotherï¿ 1/2(TM)s death and didnï¿ 1/2(TM)t want to lose a big chunk of it to the government. Captain Hadley threatened to push Robbins off the roof for confronting him and explaining a way he could keep the money legally. The high angle shot on Robbins makes him look small as he is being scolded by the Captain. As Robbins explains his legitimate plan to Captain Hadley, the camera angle begins to lower and makes Robbins look strong and worthwhile to the audience. This is a turning point for Robbins. This incident earns Robbins the guardï¿ 1/2(TM)s gratitude and in return, the Captain gets beer for all of the inmate workers. The use of robust acting and precise photography in this scene is a stunning example of what Darabont was capable of capturing in The Shawshank Redemption. Robbins doesn't quite know all the rules inside Warden Nortonï¿ 1/2(TM)s prison and ends up breaking a good many of them, even after heï¿ 1/2(TM)s won their affections. Some acts are seen as acceptable, such as offering to complete the prison staffsï¿ 1/2(TM) tax returns and asking for money from the State to fund a new library. Others, not so much. When a new inmate arrives and reveals new information about Robbinsï¿ 1/2(TM) murder allegations, Robbins asks the warden for a new hearing. But instead of gaining support from the warden, heï¿ 1/2(TM)s punished for the request and sentenced to a month of solitary confinement. As the film evolves, so does Robbins. He learns to fit in and do good for others. Freemanï¿ 1/2(TM)s role is one portraying some sort of God. He definitely has the voice. In 2003, Freeman even played God in Bruce Almighty. Both Darabont and Shadyac, director of Bruce Almighty, capture Freemenï¿ 1/2(TM)s recognizable voice as God. Award -Winning actors Harrison Ford, Clint Eastwood, and Paul Newman, auditioned for Freemanï¿ 1/2(TM)s part, but Darabont wisely pursued Freeman instead. Freeman develops a special friendship with Robbins in prison and becomes a mentor of sorts to him. In the end, Freemen serves his term and is released back into society. Unlike a previous inmate who killed himself after getting out, Freeman told himself, ï¿ 1/2Get busy living, or get busy dyingï¿ 1/2Â?. There is hope for everyone in this world, you just have to believe in it. The Shawshank Redemption is an incredible work of art. It masters all aspects of what makes a movie great. Definitely a movie worth watching.\"},\n",

       "   'Critic': 'It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. \"Shawshank\" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator\\'s calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope. Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film\\'s opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis \\'Red\\' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (\"looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over\"), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn\\'t make it in prison. From Andy\\'s arrival on the prison bus to the film\\'s end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He\\'s the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red\\'s. We\\'ve been shown by Andy\\'s example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. \"I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,\" he tells Red. \"Get busy livin\\' or get busy dyin\\'.\" The key to the film\\'s structure, I think, is that it\\'s not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles? People like excitement at the movies, and titles that provide it do well. Films about \"redemption\" are approached with great wariness; a lot of people are not thrilled by the prospect of a great film - it sounds like work. But there\\'s a hunger for messages of hope, and when a film offers one, it\\'s likely to have staying power even if it doesn\\'t grab an immediate audience. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September 1994, and opened a few weeks later. It got good reviews but did poor business (its $18 million original gross didn\\'t cover costs; it took in only another $10 million after winning seven Oscar nominations, including best picture). There wasn\\'t much going for it: It had a terrible title, it was a \"prison drama\" and women don\\'t like those, it contained almost no action, it starred actors who were respected but not big stars, and it was long at 142 minutes. Clearly this was a movie that needed word-of-mouth to find an audience, and indeed business was slowly but steadily growing when it was yanked from theaters. If it had been left to find its way, it might have continued to build and run for months, but that\\'s not what happened. Instead, in one of the most remarkable stories in home video history, it found its real mass audience on tapes and discs, and through TV screenings. Within five years, \"Shawshank\" was a phenomenon, a video best seller and renter that its admirers feel they\\'ve discovered for themselves. When the Wall Street Journal ran an article about the \"Shawshank\" groundswell in April 1999, it was occupying first place in the Internet Movie Database worldwide vote of the 250 best films; it\\'s usually in the top five. Polls and rentals reflect popularity but don\\'t explain why people value \"Shawshank\" so fervently. Maybe it plays more like a spiritual experience than a movie. It does have entertaining payoff moments (as when the guards from another prison, wearing their baseball uniforms, line up to have Andy do their taxes). But much of the movie involves quiet, solitude, and philosophical discussions about life. The moments of violence (as when Andy is sexually assaulted) are seen objectively, not exploited. The movie avoids lingering on Andy\\'s suffering; after beatings, he\\'s seen in medium and long shot, tactfully. The camera doesn\\'t focus on Andy\\'s wounds or bruises, but, like his fellow prisoners, gives him his space. The Morgan Freeman character is carrier of the film\\'s spiritual arc. We see him at three parole hearings, after 20, 30 and 40 years. The first hearing involves storytelling trickery; the film has opened with Andy\\'s sentencing, and then we see a parole board, and expect it\\'s about to listen to Andy\\'s appeal. But, no, that\\'s when we first see Red. In his first appeal he tries to convince the board he\\'s been rehabilitated. In the second, he just goes through the motions. In the third, he rejects the whole notion of rehabilitation, and somehow in doing so he sets his spirit free, and the board releases him. There\\'s an underlying problem. Behind bars, Red is king. He\\'s the prison fixer, able to get you a pack of cigarettes, a little rock pick or a Rita Hayworth poster. On the outside, he has no status or identity. We\\'ve already seen what happened to the old librarian (James Whitmore), lonely and adrift in freedom. The last act, in which Andy helps Red accept his freedom, is deeply moving - all the more so because Andy again operates at a distance, with letters and postcards, and is seen through Red\\'s mind. Frank Darabont wrote and directed the film, basing it on a story by Stephen King. His film grants itself a leisure that most films are afraid to risk. The movie is as deliberate, considered and thoughtful as Freeman\\'s narration. There\\'s a feeling in Hollywood that audiences have short attention spans and must be assaulted with fresh novelties. I think such movies are slower to sit through than a film like \"Shawshank,\" which absorbs us and takes away the awareness that we are watching a film. Deliberate, too, is the dialogue. Tim Robbins makes Andy a man of few words, quietly spoken. He doesn\\'t get real worked up. He is his own man, capable of keeping his head down for years and then indulging in a grand gesture, as when he plays an aria from Mozart\\'s \"The Marriage of Figaro.\" (The overhead shot of the prisoners in the yard, spellbound by the music, is one of the film\\'s epiphanies.) Because he does not volunteer himself, reach out to us or overplay his feelings, he becomes more fascinating: It is often better to wonder what a character is thinking than to know. Roger Deakins\\' cinematography is tactful, not showy. Two opening shots, one from a helicopter, one of prison walls looming overhead, establish the prison. Shots follow the dialogue instead of anticipating it. Thomas Newman\\'s music enhances rather than informs, and there is a subtle touch in the way deep bass rumblings during the early murder are reprised when a young prisoner recalls another man\\'s description of the crime. Darabont constructs the film to observe the story, not to punch it up or upstage it. Upstaging, in fact, is unknown in this film; the actors are content to stay within their roles, the story moves in an orderly way, and the film itself reflects the slow passage of the decades. \"When they put you in that cell,\" Red says, \"when those bars slam home, that\\'s when you know it\\'s for real. Old life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.\" Watching the film again, I admired it even more than the first time I saw it. Affection for good films often grows with familiarity, as it does with music. Some have said life is a prison, we are Red, Andy is our redeemer. All good art is about something deeper than it admits.'},\n",
